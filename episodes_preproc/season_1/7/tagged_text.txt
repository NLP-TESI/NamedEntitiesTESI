The <entity class="NE" id=1359>Lannister</entity> army , poised to invade the <entity class="NE" id=1360>Riverlands</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1361>Eddard Eddard</entity> 's investigations in <entity class="NE" id=1362>King</entity> 's Landing reach a dramatic climax as he confronts <entity class="NE" id=1363>Queen Cersei</entity> with his findings . <entity class="NE" id=1364>Tywin Tywin</entity> prepares his forces for battle and gives Jaime an important assignment . Ser Ser 's actions inspire <entity class="NE" id=1365>Khal Drogo</entity> to make an important vow . <entity class="NE" id=1366>Jon Jon</entity> finally takes his place amongst the <entity class="NE" id=1367>Night's Watch</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=1368>Lannister Camp</entity> . On the borders of the <entity class="NE" id=1369>Riverlands</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1370>Lord Tywin Lannister</entity> has assembled an army of sixty thousand men , with which he plans to oppose the <entity class="NE" id=1371>Starks</entity> and punish <entity class="NE" id=1372>Catelyn</entity> 's capture of his son <entity class="NE" id=1373>Tyrion Lannister</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1374>Tywin</entity> discusses the future of <entity class="HSE" id=1375>House Lannister</entity> with his son Jaime . As he stands in his tent skinning a dead stag , he tells his elder son , <entity class="NE" id=1376>Jaime</entity> , that this conflict will decide the fate of their family ; they will either forge a dynasty that will last a thousand years or cease to exist , as the <entity class="NE" id=1377>Targaryens</entity> had done . He orders Jaime to become the man he was meant to be , and to take thirty thousand men and besiege <entity class="NE" id=1378>Riverrun</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1379>Catelyn</entity> 's childhood home and the seat of <entity class="HSE" id=1380>House Tully</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1381>Jaime</entity> ponders why <entity class="NE" id=1382>Tywin</entity> would risk so much for the ugly , stunted son that he hates , but to Tywin a Lannister is a <entity class="NE" id=1383>Lannister</entity> - even though he considers Tyrion the least worthy member of their family , any affront to their family must be punished or it makes them look weak . In the <entity class="NE" id=1384>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1385>Theon</entity> attempts to intimidate <entity class="NE" id=1386>Osha</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=1387>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1388>Theon Greyjoy</entity> attempts to bully <entity class="NE" id=1389>Osha</entity> , the wildling woman captured in the recent raid . He insists that she refer to him as `` My Lord '' , but she is unimpressed with his antics . She points out that he is not entitled to this , as his father is still alive . <entity class="NE" id=1390>Maester Maester</entity> dismisses Theon and questions Osha about why her band crossed the <entity class="NE" id=1391>Wall</entity> and were fleeing `` as far south as south goes '' . She claims that the <entity class="NE" id=1392>White</entity> Walkers have awoken after a millennia asleep and are coming south , to <entity class="NE" id=1393>Luwin</entity> 's skepticism . At the <entity class="NE" id=1394>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1395>Jon Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1396>Samwell Tarly</entity> are standing watch atop the Wall when <entity class="NE" id=1397>Benjen</entity> 's horse is spotted returning , but , to <entity class="NE" id=1398>Jon</entity> 's horror , there is no sign of <entity class="NE" id=1397>Benjen</entity> himself . Later on , <entity class="NE" id=1399>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entity> names the trainees as men of the <entity class="NE" id=1400>Night's Watch</entity> . He hands out assignments , but to <entity class="NE" id=1401>Jon</entity> 's disgust he is being sent to the stewards , not the rangers . He will work directly for the <entity class="NE" id=1402>Lord Commander</entity> as his personal steward . His attempts to plead his case to <entity class="NE" id=1403>Maester Aemon</entity> ( who has selected <entity class="NE" id=1404>Samwell</entity> as his own steward ) are met with indifference . However , <entity class="NE" id=1405>Sam</entity> suggests to Jon that while this move was possibly orchestrated by <entity class="NE" id=1406>Ser Alliser Thorne</entity> to punish <entity class="NE" id=1407>Jon</entity> , it is also an opportunity for the <entity class="NE" id=1408>Lord Commander</entity> to groom <entity class="NE" id=1407>Jon</entity> directly for command . Both are then surprised when <entity class="NE" id=1409>Pypar</entity> admits that he was sent to the <entity class="NE" id=1410>Watch</entity> for refusing to give sexual favors to a lord , not for stealing a wheel of cheese to feed his sister as he had previously claimed . Nothing about being sent to the <entity class="NE" id=1411>Wall</entity> is fair . <entity class="NE" id=1412>Jon Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1413>Samwell Tarly</entity> swear their oaths to the <entity class="NE" id=1414>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1415>Convinced</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1416>Jon</entity> , along with <entity class="NE" id=1417>Sam</entity> , say their oath of fealty to the <entity class="NE" id=1418>Night</entity> 's Watch in front of a heart tree just inside the eaves of the <entity class="NE" id=1419>Haunted Forest</entity> and are acknowledged as men of the <entity class="NE" id=1420>Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1421>Sam</entity> decided to take the oath with <entity class="NE" id=1422>Jon</entity> to the <entity class="NE" id=1423>Old Gods</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=1424>Forest</entity> , as the Seven gods his father worshiped have never seemed to answer him . After they take their oaths , <entity class="NE" id=1425>Ghost</entity> finds a severed hand in the woods and brings it back to <entity class="NE" id=1426>Jon</entity> and a horrified Sam . Across the <entity class="NE" id=1427>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1428>Daenerys</entity> tries to convince <entity class="NE" id=1429>Drogo</entity> to invade <entity class="NE" id=1430>Westeros</entity> . The wine seller is captured after trying to poison <entity class="NE" id=1431>Daenerys</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=1432>Vaes Dothrak</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1433>Daenerys</entity> attempts to convince <entity class="NE" id=1434>Khal Drogo</entity> about the benefits of an invasion of the <entity class="NE" id=1435>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=1436>Drogo</entity> is reluctant to cross the <entity class="NE" id=1437>Narrow Sea</entity> , despite the thousands of ships they could find in the <entity class="NE" id=1438>Free</entity> Cities to do the job . He says that a man does n't need an `` iron chair '' but only a horse . <entity class="NE" id=1439>Daenerys</entity> travels to the marketplace with <entity class="NE" id=1440>Ser Jorah Mormont</entity> and her handmaidens . She asks <entity class="NE" id=1441>Jorah</entity> to help convince her husband since the <entity class="NE" id=1442>Seven Kingdoms</entity> are hers by birthright but he reminds her that her ancestor Aegon the <entity class="NE" id=1443>Conqueror</entity> took six of the <entity class="NE" id=1442>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , because he was capable of doing so ( due to his dragons ) , nothing more . <entity class="NE" id=1444>Jorah</entity> is delivered a message from <entity class="NE" id=1445>Varys</entity> , a royal pardon for his crimes ; he quickly realizes that this news would only come if he was no longer needed as a spy . Seeing <entity class="NE" id=1446>Daenerys</entity> with a wineseller who is keen for her to try a particular vintage from the <entity class="NE" id=1447>Arbor</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1448>Jorah</entity> realizes that the wine has been poisoned ; this is the assassination attempt . Having second thoughts , he steps in and stops Daenerys from drinking it . The wineseller attempts to flee , but <entity class="NE" id=1449>Rakharo</entity> brings him down with a bolo tangling his ankles . With the wine seller captured , <entity class="NE" id=1450>Ser Jorah</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=1451>Daenerys</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=1452>Robert Baratheon</entity> will never stop trying to kill her and her future children . <entity class="NE" id=1453>Drogo</entity> quickly arrives in the tent . He glares at the seller and then goes to Daenerys to ensure she is okay , before offering Jorah the reward of any horse he chooses for foiling the assassination . <entity class="NE" id=1454>Angered</entity> , he begins to yell out in <entity class="NE" id=1455>Dothraki</entity> that his army will cross the `` poison water '' as no khalasar has done before and take the <entity class="NE" id=1456>Iron Throne</entity> for his son . Drogo's khalasar departs <entity class="NE" id=1457>Vaes Dothrak</entity> the next morning , with the wine seller tied naked to the saddle of Daenerys' horse , forced to walk until he eventually falls of exhaustion and is dragged to his death . In <entity class="NE" id=1458>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=1459>Lord Lord</entity> meets with <entity class="NE" id=1460>Cersei Lannister</entity> . He tells her that he knows the secret that <entity class="NE" id=1461>Jon Arryn</entity> died for : that <entity class="NE" id=1462>Cersei</entity> 's three children are not <entity class="NE" id=1463>Robert</entity> 's , but the product of incest between her and Jaime . <entity class="NE" id=1464>Cersei</entity> does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it , comparing their love to the old Targaryen practice of marrying brother to sister ; she also admits to having despised <entity class="NE" id=1465>Robert</entity> ever since their wedding night , when <entity class="NE" id=1465>Robert</entity> drunkenly stumbled into <entity class="NE" id=1464>Cersei</entity> 's bed and called her `` Lyanna '' . <entity class="NE" id=1466>Eddard</entity> angrily tells her to take her children and leave the city immediately . When <entity class="NE" id=1467>Robert</entity> returns from his hunt , he will tell him the truth of the matter and <entity class="NE" id=1468>Cersei</entity> should run as far as she can before that happens , lest <entity class="NE" id=1467>Robert</entity> 's wrath find her . <entity class="NE" id=1469>Cersei</entity> icily calls Ned a fool for turning down the throne himself after the sack of <entity class="NE" id=1470>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=1471>Eddard</entity> tells her that he has regrets , but that is n't one of them . <entity class="NE" id=1472>Cersei</entity> departs with a chilling warning : `` When you play the game of thrones , you win or you die . There is no middle ground . `` . In one of his brothels , <entity class="NE" id=1473>Littlefinger</entity> instructs the newly-arrived <entity class="NE" id=1474>Ros</entity> and another prostitute , <entity class="NE" id=1475>Armeca</entity> , on how to please their customers and make them happy . When they ask him to join them , he refuses , saying that he only ever had eyes for one woman . He tells them about his past , how he loved and fought a duel for a woman . He lost and subsequently realized that he could never beat those in power by honorable means , as they would never let him compete on equal terms . When <entity class="NE" id=1476>Ros</entity> asks him what he wants , he says , `` Oh , everything . `` . <entity class="NE" id=1477>Robert Baratheon</entity> signs a document confirming <entity class="NE" id=1478>Eddard Stark</entity> as Protector of the <entity class="NE" id=1479>Realm</entity> . Renly finds <entity class="NE" id=1480>Eddard</entity> and tells him that <entity class="NE" id=1481>Robert</entity> has been badly mauled by a boar and is not expected to survive . <entity class="NE" id=1482>Eddard</entity> finds <entity class="NE" id=1483>Robert</entity> telling <entity class="NE" id=1484>Joffrey</entity> that he wishes he could have been a better father to him . <entity class="NE" id=1485>Eddard</entity> chooses not to tell <entity class="NE" id=1486>Robert</entity> about his discoveries to spare his final hours from pain . <entity class="NE" id=1487>Robert</entity> instructs <entity class="NE" id=1488>Eddard</entity> to take a letter naming him as the <entity class="NE" id=1489>Lord Protector</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=1490>Realm</entity> , to rule until <entity class="NE" id=1491>Joffrey</entity> comes of age . Eddard does not write <entity class="NE" id=1492>Joffrey</entity> 's name , instead saying `` the rightful heir '' . <entity class="NE" id=1493>Robert</entity> also asks him to cancel the attempt on <entity class="NE" id=1494>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> 's life . Leaving the chamber , <entity class="NE" id=1495>Eddard</entity> talks to <entity class="NE" id=1496>Varys</entity> , who slyly points out that <entity class="NE" id=1497>Lancel Lannister</entity> ensured the King kept `` refreshed '' with alcohol during the hunt , meaning his reactions were slowed and unreliable . <entity class="NE" id=1498>Varys</entity> also says it is far too late to stop the attempt on <entity class="NE" id=1499>Daenerys</entity> ' life . The letter <entity class="NE" id=1500>Ned</entity> sends to <entity class="NE" id=1501>Stannis Baratheon</entity> , informing him of his findings . At <entity class="NE" id=1502>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=1503>Renly</entity> confronts <entity class="NE" id=1504>Eddard</entity> and offers him a hundred swords to take the queen and her children into custody , but <entity class="NE" id=1504>Eddard</entity> refuses to dishonor <entity class="NE" id=1505>Robert</entity> 's last hours by shedding blood in the <entity class="NE" id=1506>Red Keep</entity> and taking frightened children hostage . Renly suggests that he could make a good king , but <entity class="NE" id=1507>Eddard</entity> angrily points out that Stannis is <entity class="NE" id=1508>Renly</entity> 's older brother and the true heir . In his study he writes a letter laying out his findings to <entity class="NE" id=1509>Lord Stannis</entity> and instructs a courier to take the message to <entity class="NE" id=1510>Dragonstone</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1511>Stannis</entity> 's island fortress . Littlefinger then arrives and talks to <entity class="NE" id=1512>Eddard</entity> , who tells him the truth about <entity class="NE" id=1513>Joffrey</entity> 's parentage . <entity class="NE" id=1514>Littlefinger</entity> suggests that they keep quiet , acknowledge Joffrey as king and make him their puppet . If he proves intractable , they can reveal the truth and crown the more malleable Renly instead . <entity class="NE" id=1515>Eddard</entity> considers this treason . <entity class="NE" id=1516>Littlefinger</entity> realizes that even though <entity class="NE" id=1517>Lord Eddard</entity> has <entity class="NE" id=1518>Robert</entity> 's edict naming him Regent and Protector of the <entity class="NE" id=1519>Realm</entity> , he does n't have the men he needs to seize control from <entity class="NE" id=1520>Cersei</entity> . He needs the loyalty of the <entity class="NE" id=1521>City Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1522>Littlefinger</entity> understands that the honorable <entity class="NE" id=1523>Eddard Stark</entity> ca n't come right out and ask him to bribe them , but agrees to do what needs to be done . <entity class="NE" id=1524>Eddard Eddard</entity> confronts King <entity class="NE" id=1525>Joffrey</entity> in the throne room . In <entity class="NE" id=1526>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=1527>Eddard</entity> is summoned to the throne room by `` King Joffrey '' ; <entity class="NE" id=1528>Robert</entity> has died . He arrives to find <entity class="NE" id=1529>Littlefinger</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1530>Varys</entity> waiting for him , along with <entity class="NE" id=1531>Commander Janos Slynt</entity> and a detachment of the <entity class="NE" id=1532>City Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1533>Varys</entity> tells him that <entity class="NE" id=1534>Renly</entity> has fled the city , along with <entity class="NE" id=1535>Ser Loras Tyrell</entity> and a number of retainers . They were last seen heading south . The party enters the throne room , where <entity class="NE" id=1536>Joffrey</entity> sits on the <entity class="NE" id=1537>Iron Throne</entity> . He demands oaths of fealty from his councilors and subjects . Instead , <entity class="NE" id=1538>Eddard</entity> gives <entity class="NE" id=1539>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> the proclamation naming him as <entity class="NE" id=1540>Lord Protector</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=1541>Realm</entity> . To <entity class="NE" id=1542>Barristan</entity> 's shock , <entity class="NE" id=1543>Cersei</entity> takes the `` paper shield '' and tears it up . Instead , she suggests that <entity class="NE" id=1544>Eddard</entity> bend the knee and swear allegiance . In return he will be allowed to return to <entity class="NE" id=1545>Winterfell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1546>Eddard</entity> responds that <entity class="NE" id=1547>Joffrey</entity> has no claim to the <entity class="NE" id=1548>Iron Throne</entity> and commands <entity class="NE" id=1549>Slynt</entity> to take the <entity class="NE" id=1550>Queen</entity> and her son into custody . Instead , the <entity class="NE" id=1551>City Watch kill k N</entity> 's bodyguards and <entity class="NE" id=1552>Littlefinger</entity> holds a knife to his throat , saying , `` I did warn you not to trust me . `` .
