The <entity id=1371>Lannister</entity> army , poised to invade the <entity id=1372>Riverlands</entity> . <entity id=1373>Eddard Eddard</entity> 's investigations in <entity id=1374>King</entity> 's Landing reach a dramatic climax as he confronts <entity id=1375>Queen Cersei</entity> with his findings . <entity id=1376>Tywin Tywin</entity> prepares his forces for battle and gives Jaime an important assignment . <entity id=1377>Ser Ser</entity> 's actions inspire <entity id=1378>Khal Drogo</entity> to make an important vow . <entity id=1379>Jon Jon</entity> finally takes his place amongst the <entity id=1380>Night's Watch</entity> . At the <entity id=1381>Lannister Camp</entity> . On the borders of the <entity id=1382>Riverlands</entity> , <entity id=1383>Lord Tywin Lannister</entity> has assembled an army of sixty thousand men , with which he plans to oppose the <entity id=1384>Starks</entity> and punish <entity id=1385>Catelyn</entity> 's capture of his son <entity id=1386>Tyrion Lannister</entity> . <entity id=1387>Tywin</entity> discusses the future of <entity id=1388>House Lannister</entity> with his son Jaime . As he stands in his tent skinning a dead stag , he tells his elder son , <entity id=1389>Jaime</entity> , that this conflict will decide the fate of their family ; they will either forge a dynasty that will last a thousand years or cease to exist , as the <entity id=1390>Targaryens</entity> had done . He orders Jaime to become the man he was meant to be , and to take thirty thousand men and besiege <entity id=1391>Riverrun</entity> , <entity id=1392>Catelyn</entity> 's childhood home and the seat of <entity id=1393>House Tully</entity> . <entity id=1394>Jaime</entity> ponders why <entity id=1395>Tywin</entity> would risk so much for the ugly , stunted son that he hates , but to Tywin a Lannister is a <entity id=1396>Lannister</entity> - even though he considers Tyrion the least worthy member of their family , any affront to their family must be punished or it makes them look weak . In the <entity id=1397>North</entity> . <entity id=1398>Theon</entity> attempts to intimidate <entity id=1399>Osha</entity> . In <entity id=1400>Winterfell</entity> , <entity id=1401>Theon Greyjoy</entity> attempts to bully <entity id=1402>Osha</entity> , the wildling woman captured in the recent raid . He insists that she refer to him as `` My Lord '' , but she is unimpressed with his antics . She points out that he is not entitled to this , as his father is still alive . <entity id=1403>Maester Maester</entity> dismisses Theon and questions Osha about why her band crossed the <entity id=1404>Wall</entity> and were fleeing `` as far south as south goes '' . She claims that the <entity id=1405>White</entity> Walkers have awoken after a millennia asleep and are coming south , to <entity id=1406>Luwin</entity> 's skepticism . At the <entity id=1407>Wall</entity> . <entity id=1408>Jon Jon</entity> and <entity id=1409>Samwell Tarly</entity> are standing watch atop the Wall when <entity id=1410>Benjen</entity> 's horse is spotted returning , but , to <entity id=1411>Jon</entity> 's horror , there is no sign of <entity id=1410>Benjen</entity> himself . Later on , <entity id=1412>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entity> names the trainees as men of the <entity id=1413>Night's Watch</entity> . He hands out assignments , but to <entity id=1414>Jon</entity> 's disgust he is being sent to the stewards , not the rangers . He will work directly for the <entity id=1415>Lord Commander</entity> as his personal steward . His attempts to plead his case to <entity id=1416>Maester Aemon</entity> ( who has selected <entity id=1417>Samwell</entity> as his own steward ) are met with indifference . However , <entity id=1418>Sam</entity> suggests to Jon that while this move was possibly orchestrated by <entity id=1419>Ser Alliser Thorne</entity> to punish <entity id=1420>Jon</entity> , it is also an opportunity for the <entity id=1421>Lord Commander</entity> to groom <entity id=1420>Jon</entity> directly for command . Both are then surprised when <entity id=1422>Pypar</entity> admits that he was sent to the <entity id=1423>Watch</entity> for refusing to give sexual favors to a lord , not for stealing a wheel of cheese to feed his sister as he had previously claimed . Nothing about being sent to the <entity id=1424>Wall</entity> is fair . <entity id=1425>Jon Jon</entity> and <entity id=1426>Samwell Tarly</entity> swear their oaths to the <entity id=1427>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity id=1428>Convinced</entity> , <entity id=1429>Jon</entity> , along with <entity id=1430>Sam</entity> , say their oath of fealty to the <entity id=1431>Night</entity> 's Watch in front of a heart tree just inside the eaves of the <entity id=1432>Haunted Forest</entity> and are acknowledged as men of the <entity id=1433>Watch</entity> . <entity id=1434>Sam</entity> decided to take the oath with <entity id=1435>Jon</entity> to the <entity id=1436>Old Gods</entity> of the <entity id=1437>Forest</entity> , as the Seven gods his father worshiped have never seemed to answer him . After they take their oaths , <entity id=1438>Ghost</entity> finds a severed hand in the woods and brings it back to <entity id=1439>Jon</entity> and a horrified Sam . Across the <entity id=1440>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity id=1441>Daenerys</entity> tries to convince <entity id=1442>Drogo</entity> to invade <entity id=1443>Westeros</entity> . The wine seller is captured after trying to poison <entity id=1444>Daenerys</entity> . In <entity id=1445>Vaes Dothrak</entity> , <entity id=1446>Daenerys</entity> attempts to convince <entity id=1447>Khal Drogo</entity> about the benefits of an invasion of the <entity id=1448>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , but <entity id=1449>Drogo</entity> is reluctant to cross the <entity id=1450>Narrow Sea</entity> , despite the thousands of ships they could find in the <entity id=1451>Free</entity> Cities to do the job . He says that a man does n't need an `` iron chair '' but only a horse . <entity id=1452>Daenerys</entity> travels to the marketplace with <entity id=1453>Ser Jorah Mormont</entity> and her handmaidens . She asks <entity id=1454>Jorah</entity> to help convince her husband since the <entity id=1455>Seven Kingdoms</entity> are hers by birthright but he reminds her that her ancestor Aegon the <entity id=1456>Conqueror</entity> took six of the <entity id=1455>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , because he was capable of doing so ( due to his dragons ) , nothing more . <entity id=1457>Jorah</entity> is delivered a message from <entity id=1458>Varys</entity> , a royal pardon for his crimes ; he quickly realizes that this news would only come if he was no longer needed as a spy . Seeing <entity id=1459>Daenerys</entity> with a wineseller who is keen for her to try a particular vintage from the <entity id=1460>Arbor</entity> , <entity id=1461>Jorah</entity> realizes that the wine has been poisoned ; this is the assassination attempt . Having second thoughts , he steps in and stops Daenerys from drinking it . The wineseller attempts to flee , but <entity id=1462>Rakharo</entity> brings him down with a bolo tangling his ankles . With the wine seller captured , <entity id=1463>Ser Jorah</entity> tells <entity id=1464>Daenerys</entity> that <entity id=1465>Robert Baratheon</entity> will never stop trying to kill her and her future children . <entity id=1466>Drogo</entity> quickly arrives in the tent . He glares at the seller and then goes to Daenerys to ensure she is okay , before offering Jorah the reward of any horse he chooses for foiling the assassination . <entity id=1467>Angered</entity> , he begins to yell out in <entity id=1468>Dothraki</entity> that his army will cross the `` poison water '' as no khalasar has done before and take the <entity id=1469>Iron Throne</entity> for his son . Drogo's khalasar departs <entity id=1470>Vaes Dothrak</entity> the next morning , with the wine seller tied naked to the saddle of Daenerys' horse , forced to walk until he eventually falls of exhaustion and is dragged to his death . In <entity id=1471>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity id=1472>Lord Lord</entity> meets with <entity id=1473>Cersei Lannister</entity> . He tells her that he knows the secret that <entity id=1474>Jon Arryn</entity> died for : that <entity id=1475>Cersei</entity> 's three children are not <entity id=1476>Robert</entity> 's , but the product of incest between her and Jaime . <entity id=1477>Cersei</entity> does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it , comparing their love to the old Targaryen practice of marrying brother to sister ; she also admits to having despised <entity id=1478>Robert</entity> ever since their wedding night , when <entity id=1478>Robert</entity> drunkenly stumbled into <entity id=1477>Cersei</entity> 's bed and called her `` Lyanna '' . <entity id=1479>Eddard</entity> angrily tells her to take her children and leave the city immediately . When <entity id=1480>Robert</entity> returns from his hunt , he will tell him the truth of the matter and <entity id=1481>Cersei</entity> should run as far as she can before that happens , lest <entity id=1480>Robert</entity> 's wrath find her . <entity id=1482>Cersei</entity> icily calls Ned a fool for turning down the throne himself after the sack of <entity id=1483>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity id=1484>Eddard</entity> tells her that he has regrets , but that is n't one of them . <entity id=1485>Cersei</entity> departs with a chilling warning : `` When you play the game of thrones , you win or you die . There is no middle ground . `` . In one of his brothels , <entity id=1486>Littlefinger</entity> instructs the newly-arrived <entity id=1487>Ros</entity> and another prostitute , <entity id=1488>Armeca</entity> , on how to please their customers and make them happy . When they ask him to join them , he refuses , saying that he only ever had eyes for one woman . He tells them about his past , how he loved and fought a duel for a woman . He lost and subsequently realized that he could never beat those in power by honorable means , as they would never let him compete on equal terms . When <entity id=1489>Ros</entity> asks him what he wants , he says , `` Oh , everything . `` . <entity id=1490>Robert Baratheon</entity> signs a document confirming <entity id=1491>Eddard Stark</entity> as Protector of the <entity id=1492>Realm</entity> . Renly finds <entity id=1493>Eddard</entity> and tells him that <entity id=1494>Robert</entity> has been badly mauled by a boar and is not expected to survive . <entity id=1495>Eddard</entity> finds <entity id=1496>Robert</entity> telling <entity id=1497>Joffrey</entity> that he wishes he could have been a better father to him . <entity id=1498>Eddard</entity> chooses not to tell <entity id=1499>Robert</entity> about his discoveries to spare his final hours from pain . <entity id=1500>Robert</entity> instructs <entity id=1501>Eddard</entity> to take a letter naming him as the <entity id=1502>Lord Protector</entity> of the <entity id=1503>Realm</entity> , to rule until <entity id=1504>Joffrey</entity> comes of age . Eddard does not write <entity id=1505>Joffrey</entity> 's name , instead saying `` the rightful heir '' . <entity id=1506>Robert</entity> also asks him to cancel the attempt on <entity id=1507>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> 's life . Leaving the chamber , <entity id=1508>Eddard</entity> talks to <entity id=1509>Varys</entity> , who slyly points out that <entity id=1510>Lancel Lannister</entity> ensured the King kept `` refreshed '' with alcohol during the hunt , meaning his reactions were slowed and unreliable . <entity id=1511>Varys</entity> also says it is far too late to stop the attempt on <entity id=1512>Daenerys</entity> ' life . The letter <entity id=1513>Ned</entity> sends to <entity id=1514>Stannis Baratheon</entity> , informing him of his findings . At <entity id=1515>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity id=1516>Renly</entity> confronts <entity id=1517>Eddard</entity> and offers him a hundred swords to take the queen and her children into custody , but <entity id=1517>Eddard</entity> refuses to dishonor <entity id=1518>Robert</entity> 's last hours by shedding blood in the <entity id=1519>Red Keep</entity> and taking frightened children hostage . Renly suggests that he could make a good king , but <entity id=1520>Eddard</entity> angrily points out that Stannis is <entity id=1521>Renly</entity> 's older brother and the true heir . In his study he writes a letter laying out his findings to <entity id=1522>Lord Stannis</entity> and instructs a courier to take the message to <entity id=1523>Dragonstone</entity> , <entity id=1524>Stannis</entity> 's island fortress . Littlefinger then arrives and talks to <entity id=1525>Eddard</entity> , who tells him the truth about <entity id=1526>Joffrey</entity> 's parentage . <entity id=1527>Littlefinger</entity> suggests that they keep quiet , acknowledge Joffrey as king and make him their puppet . If he proves intractable , they can reveal the truth and crown the more malleable Renly instead . <entity id=1528>Eddard</entity> considers this treason . <entity id=1529>Littlefinger</entity> realizes that even though <entity id=1530>Lord Eddard</entity> has <entity id=1531>Robert</entity> 's edict naming him Regent and Protector of the <entity id=1532>Realm</entity> , he does n't have the men he needs to seize control from <entity id=1533>Cersei</entity> . He needs the loyalty of the <entity id=1534>City Watch</entity> . <entity id=1535>Littlefinger</entity> understands that the honorable <entity id=1536>Eddard Stark</entity> ca n't come right out and ask him to bribe them , but agrees to do what needs to be done . <entity id=1537>Eddard Eddard</entity> confronts King <entity id=1538>Joffrey</entity> in the throne room . In <entity id=1539>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity id=1540>Eddard</entity> is summoned to the throne room by `` King Joffrey '' ; <entity id=1541>Robert</entity> has died . He arrives to find <entity id=1542>Littlefinger</entity> and <entity id=1543>Varys</entity> waiting for him , along with <entity id=1544>Commander Janos Slynt</entity> and a detachment of the <entity id=1545>City Watch</entity> . <entity id=1546>Varys</entity> tells him that <entity id=1547>Renly</entity> has fled the city , along with <entity id=1548>Ser Loras Tyrell</entity> and a number of retainers . They were last seen heading south . The party enters the throne room , where <entity id=1549>Joffrey</entity> sits on the <entity id=1550>Iron Throne</entity> . He demands oaths of fealty from his councilors and subjects . Instead , <entity id=1551>Eddard</entity> gives <entity id=1552>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> the proclamation naming him as <entity id=1553>Lord Protector</entity> of the <entity id=1554>Realm</entity> . To <entity id=1555>Barristan</entity> 's shock , <entity id=1556>Cersei</entity> takes the `` paper shield '' and tears it up . Instead , she suggests that <entity id=1557>Eddard</entity> bend the knee and swear allegiance . In return he will be allowed to return to <entity id=1558>Winterfell</entity> . <entity id=1559>Eddard</entity> responds that <entity id=1560>Joffrey</entity> has no claim to the <entity id=1561>Iron Throne</entity> and commands <entity id=1562>Slynt</entity> to take the <entity id=1563>Queen</entity> and her son into custody . Instead , the <entity id=1564>City Watch kill k N</entity> 's bodyguards and <entity id=1565>Littlefinger</entity> holds a knife to his throat , saying , `` I did warn you not to trust me . `` .
