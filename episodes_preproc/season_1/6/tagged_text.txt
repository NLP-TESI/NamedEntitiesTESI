In <entity class="NE" id=1135>Vaes Dothrak</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1136>Viserys</entity> ' frustrations at the constant delays before he can receive his crown boil over . In <entity class="NE" id=1137>King</entity> 's Landing , while King <entity class="NE" id=1138>Robert</entity> goes on a hunt , <entity class="NE" id=1139>Eddard</entity> issues a decree that could splinter the <entity class="NE" id=1140>Seven Kingdoms</entity> and makes a startling discovery about the heirs to the throne . In the <entity class="NE" id=1141>Eyrie</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1142>Tyrion Lannister</entity> wagers everything on the greed of the sellsword <entity class="NE" id=1143>Bronn</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=1144>Crownlands</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1145>Lord Lord</entity> wakes up after a long period of unconsciousness , due to the injuries inflicted on him by <entity class="NE" id=1146>Jaime Lannister</entity> 's men . He finds both King <entity class="NE" id=1147>Robert Baratheon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1148>Queen Cersei</entity> waiting . King <entity class="NE" id=1149>Robert</entity> 's hunting party . <entity class="NE" id=1150>Cersei</entity> is furious with <entity class="NE" id=1151>Eddard</entity> 's acts in having her brother Tyrion arrested and attacking Jaime in the street . She wants <entity class="NE" id=1152>Robert</entity> to take action against him , but <entity class="NE" id=1152>Robert</entity> refuses to condemn him without hearing <entity class="NE" id=1153>Eddard</entity> 's side , and tells her to be silent . When <entity class="NE" id=1154>Cersei</entity> protests further , and calls <entity class="NE" id=1155>Robert</entity> a woman , he hits her . She says that she will wear the bruise with honor . He tells her to be silent , or he will honor her again , and <entity class="NE" id=1156>Cersei</entity> leaves in anger . Afterwards , <entity class="NE" id=1157>Robert</entity> restores <entity class="NE" id=1158>Eddard</entity> to his position as <entity class="NE" id=1159>King</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=1160>Hand</entity> , and tells him not to quit again , or he will give the position to <entity class="NE" id=1161>Jaime Lannister</entity> . He tells <entity class="NE" id=1162>Lord Eddard</entity> to end the animosity between <entity class="HSE" id=1163>House Stark</entity> and <entity class="HSE" id=1164>House Lannister</entity> , as strife between these two powerful houses could lead them into war . He is leaving on a hunt and wants the realm at peace by the time he returns . <entity class="NE" id=1165>Arya</entity> has another `` dancing '' lesson with <entity class="NE" id=1166>Syrio Forel</entity> , but is n't in the mood due to <entity class="NE" id=1167>Jory</entity> 's death . <entity class="NE" id=1168>Syrio</entity> tells her that she may need to fight at any time , not just when she 's in the mood . He wisely reminds her that being prepared to fight is more important in times of sadness than in peaceful times of happiness . King <entity class="NE" id=1169>Robert</entity> is out hunting , accompanied by his brother Renly , <entity class="NE" id=1170>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1171>Lancel Lannister</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1172>Robert</entity> , being supplied with wine by <entity class="NE" id=1173>Lancel</entity> , becomes drunk and nostalgic , longing for the days of young knights trying to make a name for themselves and when enemies stood openly in opposition ( instead of being hidden schemers ) . <entity class="NE" id=1174>Robert</entity> brags about all the women he has bedded , but Renly becomes irate when he begins to question him about his history with women . Renly calls him a fool and remarks that the past had its share of violence that <entity class="NE" id=1175>Robert</entity> is conveniently ignoring . Renly storms off , leaving <entity class="NE" id=1176>Ser Barristan</entity> to look on concerned , as <entity class="NE" id=1177>Lancel</entity> keeps up King <entity class="NE" id=1178>Robert</entity> 's wine supply . In <entity class="NE" id=1179>King</entity> 's Landing , at a meeting of the small council , a group of refugees come to tell of how their villages have been destroyed . <entity class="NE" id=1180>Eddard</entity> hears tales of a huge knight ravaging the <entity class="NE" id=1181>Riverlands</entity> . He realizes that it 's <entity class="NE" id=1182>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> , `` The <entity class="NE" id=1183>Mountain</entity> '' , who is likely under Lannister orders to punish the <entity class="NE" id=1184>Riverlands</entity> - which are held by <entity class="HSE" id=1185>House Tully</entity> , the former House of his wife <entity class="NE" id=1186>Catelyn</entity> , who now holds <entity class="NE" id=1187>Tyrion</entity> captive . Even though King <entity class="NE" id=1188>Robert</entity> told him to make peace with the <entity class="NE" id=1189>Lannisters</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1190>Lord Eddard</entity> could not bring himself to let this injustice stand . <entity class="NE" id=1191>Eddard</entity> strips <entity class="NE" id=1192>Gregor Clegane</entity> of his knighthood , land , and titles , and sends <entity class="NE" id=1193>Lord Beric Dondarrion</entity> with a retinue of one hundred knights to arrest and execute him in the king 's name . <entity class="NE" id=1194>Eddard</entity> discovers the secret <entity class="NE" id=1195>Jon Arryn</entity> died for . He also orders <entity class="NE" id=1196>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> to send word to <entity class="NE" id=1197>Casterly Rock</entity> , demanding <entity class="NE" id=1198>Lord Tywin Lannister</entity> 's presence in court to explain his bannerman 's actions or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm . 'Littlefinger ' <entity class="NE" id=1199>Petyr Baelish</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=1200>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> are both concerned with the harshness of these orders and <entity class="NE" id=1201>Eddard</entity> 's actions against the <entity class="NE" id=1202>Lannisters</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=1201>Eddard</entity> wants to see justice done . <entity class="NE" id=1203>Prince Prince</entity> comes to apologize to <entity class="NE" id=1204>Sansa</entity> for the incident on the <entity class="NE" id=1205>Kingsroad</entity> . He calls her his lady love and gives her a necklace . <entity class="NE" id=1206>Sansa</entity> forgives him , and they seem reconciled . <entity class="NE" id=1207>Sansa</entity> is unaware that the <entity class="NE" id=1208>Queen</entity> put <entity class="NE" id=1209>Joffrey</entity> up to the apology some time ago . <entity class="NE" id=1210>Eddard</entity> decides to send his daughters back to <entity class="NE" id=1211>Winterfell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1212>Arya</entity> is worried that she must leave <entity class="NE" id=1213>Syrio</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1214>Sansa</entity> protests that no one cares about her trivial dancing instructor , they are talking about breaking her betrothal to <entity class="NE" id=1215>Joffrey</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1216>Lord Lord</entity> says that he will find someone else for her . <entity class="NE" id=1217>Sansa</entity> refuses—she is going to marry <entity class="NE" id=1218>Joffrey</entity> and have lots of golden-haired babies . This gives <entity class="NE" id=1219>Eddard</entity> pause and sends him back to the book that <entity class="NE" id=1220>Jon Arryn</entity> was looking at before he died . Consulting the book 's entry on <entity class="HSE" id=1221>House Baratheon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1222>Lord Eddard</entity> finds that every time a <entity class="NE" id=1223>Baratheon</entity> has married , the children have had black hair…right up to <entity class="NE" id=1224>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1225>Robert</entity> 's children , who are all blond . In the <entity class="NE" id=1226>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1227>Stiv</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1228>Osha</entity> accost <entity class="NE" id=1229>Bran</entity> near <entity class="NE" id=1230>Winterfell</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=1231>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1232>Bran</entity> has another dream about the three-eyed raven , in which it flies into the castle 's crypts . He wakes up to find that <entity class="NE" id=1233>Hodor</entity> has brought the finished saddle designed by <entity class="NE" id=1234>Tyrion</entity> . He goes on a ride with <entity class="NE" id=1235>Robb</entity> and Theon . They have had word from <entity class="NE" id=1236>King</entity> 's Landing about <entity class="NE" id=1237>Eddard</entity> 's injury , <entity class="NE" id=1238>Jory</entity> 's death and <entity class="NE" id=1239>Tyrion</entity> 's capture . <entity class="NE" id=1240>Theon</entity> thinks that <entity class="NE" id=1241>Robb</entity> should prepare the <entity class="NE" id=1242>North</entity> for war , but <entity class="NE" id=1241>Robb</entity> is determined to make his own decision for when that time has come , and until then will follow his parents ' orders to remain in <entity class="NE" id=1243>Winterfell</entity> . They discover that <entity class="NE" id=1244>Bran</entity> has wandered off on his horse and go looking for him . <entity class="NE" id=1245>Robb</entity> finds a group of wildlings threatening <entity class="NE" id=1246>Bran</entity> and trying to steal his horse . <entity class="NE" id=1247>Robb</entity> kills two , but another wildling holds <entity class="NE" id=1248>Bran</entity> with a knife to the throat . Theon shoots him from behind , angering <entity class="NE" id=1249>Robb</entity> by endangering <entity class="NE" id=1250>Bran</entity> . The remaining wildling , a woman named <entity class="NE" id=1251>Osha</entity> , yields and begs for her life . <entity class="NE" id=1252>Robb</entity> agrees to take her as a prisoner . <entity class="NE" id=1253>Theon</entity> tells Ros he will miss her as she leaves for King 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=1254>Ros</entity> , the prostitute that Theon frequently sees , is departing <entity class="NE" id=1255>Winterfell</entity> for King 's Landing on the back of a turnip cart . <entity class="NE" id=1256>Theon</entity> stops her and unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay . She explains that war is now imminent and the men ( and thus her customer base ) of <entity class="NE" id=1257>Winterfell</entity> are destined to leave soon and probably never return ; her departure is thus an economically essential decision . He throws her a coin to get her to raise her skirt one last time . As she rides off he says that he will miss her . She agrees that he will . <entity class="NE" id=1258>Tyrion</entity> 's verbal skills are wasted on Mord . In the <entity class="NE" id=1259>Vale</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=1260>Eyrie</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1261>Tyrion</entity> almost rolls out of his sky cell in his sleep , to his consternation . He tries to make a bargain with the gaoler , <entity class="NE" id=1262>Mord</entity> , to no avail . <entity class="NE" id=1263>Tyrion</entity> convinces Mord to carry a message to <entity class="NE" id=1264>Lady Lysa Arryn</entity> and , in exchange , he will give Mord the gold he had with him when he was captured . <entity class="NE" id=1265>Lysa</entity> summons <entity class="NE" id=1266>Tyrion</entity> , believing that the sky cell has broken his spirit , but all he confesses to is being a liar , a whoremonger , and a player of practical jokes . He maintains his innocence of the crimes of conspiracy to commit murder . <entity class="NE" id=1267>Tyrion</entity> on trial in the <entity class="NE" id=1268>Eyrie</entity> . However , <entity class="NE" id=1269>Tyrion</entity> uses the opportunity of his audience in front of <entity class="NE" id=1270>Lysa</entity> 's court to publicly demand his right to justice and a trial , and <entity class="NE" id=1270>Lysa</entity> is shamed into agreeing . Given that <entity class="NE" id=1271>Lysa</entity> 's son is a young boy and would n't make a good judge in a formal trial , <entity class="NE" id=1272>Tyrion</entity> instead demands a trial by combat , which <entity class="NE" id=1271>Lysa</entity> also reluctantly agrees is his right . Given that neither Lysa nor her young son can fight in a trial by combat , she asks for a volunteer to be her champion , and <entity class="NE" id=1273>Ser Vardis Egen</entity> agrees . <entity class="NE" id=1274>Egen</entity> is unwilling to fight <entity class="NE" id=1275>Tyrion</entity> however , as killing such an outmatched opponent would be dishonourable . <entity class="NE" id=1276>Tyrion</entity> names his own champion : his brother Jaime , considered one of the best swordsmen in the realm . At this Lysa does object , as <entity class="NE" id=1277>Jaime</entity> is not present and she does not want to wait . She demands that he pick a champion from those present . <entity class="NE" id=1278>Tyrion</entity> desperately asks for volunteers , and after a long pause during which it seems that <entity class="NE" id=1278>Tyrion</entity> 's cause is lost , the sellsword <entity class="NE" id=1279>Bronn</entity> steps forward and says he will stand for him . <entity class="NE" id=1280>Bronn</entity> kicks <entity class="NE" id=1281>Ser Vardis Egen</entity> 's corpse out of the <entity class="NE" id=1282>Moon Door</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1283>Bronn</entity> fights defensively , waiting for <entity class="NE" id=1284>Vardis</entity> to tire , as unlike Bronn he is dressed in full armor . <entity class="NE" id=1285>Bronn</entity> finally gets his chance ; he first wounds and then kills <entity class="NE" id=1286>Vardis</entity> , sending his body rolling out of the `` <entity class="NE" id=1287>Moon Door</entity> '' that leads to a thousand-foot drop . <entity class="NE" id=1288>Lysa</entity> complains that <entity class="NE" id=1289>Bronn</entity> did not fight with honor . <entity class="NE" id=1290>Bronn</entity> agrees , but indicates that <entity class="NE" id=1291>Vardis</entity> did fight with honor . <entity class="NE" id=1292>Tyrion</entity> has proven his innocence in the eyes of the gods . He retrieves his gold from <entity class="NE" id=1293>Ser Rodrik</entity> and gives it to <entity class="NE" id=1294>Mord</entity> . When <entity class="NE" id=1295>Robin</entity> asks if he can make the little man fly now , <entity class="NE" id=1296>Tyrion</entity> says , `` This little man is going home . '' <entity class="NE" id=1297>Bronn</entity> and Tyrion are allowed to depart . Across the <entity class="NE" id=1298>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1299>Daenerys</entity> and one of her dragon eggs . In <entity class="NE" id=1300>Vaes Dothrak</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1301>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> is studying her dragon eggs . Despite <entity class="NE" id=1302>Illyrio</entity> 's claim that they are now only stone , she ponders if they might be hatched by extreme heat , and places an egg on a brazier . <entity class="NE" id=1303>Nothing</entity> happens , to her disappointment . She is removing the egg from the brazier , when <entity class="NE" id=1304>Irri</entity> comes in and thinks she will scald herself . <entity class="NE" id=1305>Irri</entity> takes the egg from her , but <entity class="NE" id=1306>Daenerys</entity> is completely unharmed , and it is Irri who suffers scalding burns on her own hands . <entity class="NE" id=1307>Daenerys</entity> is summoned by the crones who rule the city , the dosh khaleen , the wives of khals slain in battle . She eats a stallion 's heart and the crones read the omens . At first it seems <entity class="NE" id=1308>Dany</entity> wo n't keep the raw meat down , but , to both her and <entity class="NE" id=1309>Drogo</entity> 's relief , she is able to compose herself . The crones declare <entity class="NE" id=1310>Daenerys</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1311>Drogo</entity> 's son will be `` The Stallion That Mounts The World '' , a great conqueror whose coming is long foretold in <entity class="NE" id=1312>Dothraki</entity> history . <entity class="NE" id=1313>Daenerys</entity> says his name will be <entity class="NE" id=1314>Rhaego</entity> , for her brother <entity class="NE" id=1315>Rhaegar</entity> , slain by the usurper <entity class="NE" id=1316>Robert Baratheon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1317>Viserys</entity> is not impressed and rather disgusted by it all . He stands with <entity class="NE" id=1318>Ser Jorah</entity> who explains the ritual to him . It is only when the Dothraki are chanting <entity class="NE" id=1319>Rhaego</entity> 's name , and <entity class="NE" id=1320>Drogo</entity> lifts <entity class="NE" id=1321>Daenerys</entity> up and carries her about the room , that <entity class="NE" id=1322>Viserys</entity> realizes they love her . <entity class="NE" id=1323>Jorah Mormont</entity> prevents Viserys from stealing <entity class="NE" id=1324>Dany</entity> 's eggs . He storms out of the tent . <entity class="NE" id=1325>Viserys</entity> is later discovered in <entity class="NE" id=1326>Daenerys</entity> ' tent by <entity class="NE" id=1327>Ser Jorah Mormont</entity> , trying to steal <entity class="NE" id=1328>Dany</entity> 's dragon eggs , but <entity class="NE" id=1329>Jorah</entity> wo n't let him . <entity class="NE" id=1330>Viserys</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=1331>Ser Jorah</entity> that to rule one must be feared or loved , and he has never been loved as the <entity class="NE" id=1332>Dothraki</entity> love <entity class="NE" id=1333>Dany</entity> . He says he knows that <entity class="NE" id=1334>Jorah</entity> wants <entity class="NE" id=1335>Daenerys</entity> , but he does n't care . He just wants the eggs so he can hire an army , but he ca n't get past <entity class="NE" id=1336>Ser Jorah</entity> and must leave the eggs . <entity class="NE" id=1337>Mormont</entity> watches him as he leaves . <entity class="NE" id=1338>Drunk</entity> , bitter and angry , <entity class="NE" id=1339>Viserys</entity> interrupts a feast for <entity class="NE" id=1340>Daenerys</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1341>Drogo</entity> . He angrily demands his payment in return for giving <entity class="NE" id=1342>Daenerys</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=1343>Drogo</entity> . Then he draws his sword , which is considered an offense punishable by death in the sacred city , and threatens <entity class="NE" id=1344>Dany</entity> and the unborn child , while <entity class="NE" id=1345>Irri</entity> translates to <entity class="NE" id=1346>Drogo</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1347>Khal Khal</entity> gives <entity class="NE" id=1348>Viserys</entity> a golden crown . <entity class="NE" id=1349>Drogo</entity> responds that he will give <entity class="NE" id=1350>Viserys</entity> a golden crown `` that men will tremble to behold '' , and <entity class="NE" id=1350>Viserys</entity> is pleased until <entity class="NE" id=1349>Drogo</entity> 's bloodrider <entity class="NE" id=1351>Qotho</entity> breaks his arm , making him drop the sword , and kicks him to the floor . <entity class="NE" id=1352>Drogo</entity> melts his golden belt in a pot , while <entity class="NE" id=1353>Viserys</entity> begs <entity class="NE" id=1354>Daenerys</entity> to help him . Ser Ser tells her to look away , but she wo n't . She watches as <entity class="NE" id=1355>Khal Drogo</entity> `` crowns '' Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head , causing <entity class="NE" id=1356>Viserys</entity> to cry out in pure agony . As <entity class="NE" id=1357>Daenerys</entity> watches her brother die , she coldly states that , having been killed by fire , <entity class="NE" id=1358>Viserys</entity> was no true dragon .
