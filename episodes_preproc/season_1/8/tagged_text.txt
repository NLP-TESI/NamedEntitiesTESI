In the aftermath of <entity class="NE" id=1566>Nedʼs</entity> capture , <entity class="NE" id=1567>Syrio</entity> and Arya face off against Lannister guards , while <entity class="NE" id=1568>Cersei</entity> manipulates <entity class="NE" id=1569>Sansa</entity> to her own ends . <entity class="NE" id=1570>Robb</entity> rallies his fatherʼs northern bannermen against <entity class="NE" id=1571>Tywin Lannister</entity> and heads south to war . <entity class="NE" id=1572>Tyrion</entity> forms an uneasy alliance with the hill tribes and reunites with his father . <entity class="NE" id=1573>Jon</entity> lashes out at <entity class="NE" id=1574>Ser Alliser Thorne</entity> and battles a mysterious attacker from beyond the <entity class="NE" id=1575>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1576>Dany</entity> is forced to reconcile her desire to conquer <entity class="NE" id=1577>Westeros</entity> with <entity class="NE" id=1578>Drogoʼs</entity> savagery after the <entity class="NE" id=1579>Dothraki</entity> raid a peaceful village . At the <entity class="NE" id=1580>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1581>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1582>Sam</entity> return to <entity class="NE" id=1583>Castle Black</entity> with their party and two dead bodies in tow . The two corpses are identified as members of <entity class="NE" id=1584>Benjen Stark</entity> 's missing ranging party , <entity class="NE" id=1585>Jafer Flowers</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1586>Othor</entity> . Though the deceased appear to have been dead for some time , <entity class="NE" id=1587>Sam</entity> astutely notes that the bodies do not smell like they have been rotting . <entity class="NE" id=1588>Jon</entity> and several other <entity class="NE" id=1589>Sworn Brothers</entity> urge <entity class="NE" id=1590>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entity> to burn the bodies , but he refuses , wanting <entity class="NE" id=1591>Maester Aemon</entity> to examine them . <entity class="NE" id=1592>Jon</entity> is summoned to <entity class="NE" id=1593>Mormont</entity> 's chambers as news has arrived of <entity class="NE" id=1594>Eddard</entity> 's arrest and imprisonment . After being given the letter to read for himself , a speechless <entity class="NE" id=1595>Jon</entity> attempts to leave before <entity class="NE" id=1596>Mormont</entity> reminds him of the oath he has sworn to the <entity class="NE" id=1597>Night's Watch</entity> . When <entity class="NE" id=1598>Jon</entity> expresses concern for his sisters , <entity class="NE" id=1599>Mormont</entity> replies he is sure they are unharmed , though <entity class="NE" id=1598>Jon</entity> is doubtful . Later on , <entity class="NE" id=1600>Alliser Thorne</entity> taunts <entity class="NE" id=1601>Jon</entity> that his father is a traitor , calling him , `` not just a bastard , a traitor 's bastard . '' <entity class="NE" id=1602>Jon</entity> angrily charges at him with a knife and <entity class="NE" id=1603>Thorne</entity> is only saved by <entity class="NE" id=1604>Grenn</entity> and Pyp holding <entity class="NE" id=1602>Jon</entity> back . <entity class="NE" id=1605>Commander Commander</entity> witnessed the incident and confines <entity class="NE" id=1606>Jon</entity> to quarters for his trouble . That night , <entity class="NE" id=1607>Jon</entity> is aroused by a whining <entity class="NE" id=1608>Ghost</entity> scratching at the door . Sensing trouble , <entity class="NE" id=1609>Jon</entity> and his direwolf head to the <entity class="NE" id=1610>Lord Commander</entity> 's chambers where <entity class="NE" id=1609>Jon</entity> is confronted by a wight , the reanimated corpse of the dead <entity class="NE" id=1611>Night</entity> 's Watchman . Though <entity class="NE" id=1612>Jon</entity> is able to stab the wight through the chest with his sword , the wight simply removes the sword and is unharmed . <entity class="NE" id=1613>Mormont</entity> appears , seeking out the commotion . <entity class="NE" id=1614>Jon</entity> grabs <entity class="NE" id=1615>Mormont</entity> 's oil lamp and throws it at the wight , finally destroying it . The morning after , the two wight bodies have been thoroughly burned . <entity class="NE" id=1616>Sam</entity> says he read in a book that the dead are animated by the touch of the <entity class="NE" id=1617>White Walkers</entity> and only fire can destroy such creatures . He hopes the <entity class="NE" id=1618>Wall</entity> is big enough to hold them back when the <entity class="NE" id=1619>Walkers</entity> come in force . In the <entity class="NE" id=1620>Vale</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=1621>Eyrie</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1622>Catelyn</entity> is furious with <entity class="NE" id=1623>Lysa</entity> : first for <entity class="NE" id=1623>Lysa</entity> not immediately notifying her about <entity class="NE" id=1624>Eddard</entity> 's arrest and second for refusing to consider summoning the knights of the <entity class="NE" id=1625>Vale</entity> to war . Despite setting in motion this chain of events with her letter to her sister regarding the murder of <entity class="NE" id=1626>Jon Arryn</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1627>Lysa</entity> does not believe that war is in the <entity class="NE" id=1628>Vale</entity> 's best interests and rather want the knights to stay in the <entity class="NE" id=1628>Vale</entity> to protect her son and their Lord . <entity class="NE" id=1629>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1630>Bronn</entity> have reached the western edge of the <entity class="NE" id=1631>Vale</entity> and are surrounded by members of the hill tribes , led by a fearsome warrior named <entity class="NE" id=1632>Shagga</entity> . At first he orders them to be killed , but <entity class="NE" id=1633>Tyrion</entity> does some fast-talking and convinces the hill tribes that <entity class="HSE" id=1634>House Lannister</entity> is an enemy of the <entity class="HSE" id=1635>House Arryn</entity> and its rulers . He proposes an alliance which will allow the tribes to enact vengeance against <entity class="HSE" id=1636>House Arryn</entity> and take ownership of the lands of the <entity class="NE" id=1637>Vale</entity> . They eagerly agree , and escort <entity class="NE" id=1638>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1639>Bronn</entity> westwards towards where the <entity class="NE" id=1640>Lannister</entity> armies are gathering . In the <entity class="NE" id=1641>North</entity> . Dozens of ravens leaving <entity class="NE" id=1642>Winterfell</entity> , summoning the banners of the <entity class="NE" id=1643>North</entity> to war . <entity class="NE" id=1644>Robb</entity> receives a letter from <entity class="NE" id=1645>Sansa</entity> in <entity class="NE" id=1646>King</entity> 's Landing , asking him to pledge fealty to King Joffrey . <entity class="NE" id=1647>Maester Maester</entity> correctly deduces the letter is actually the work of the Queen . <entity class="NE" id=1648>Robb</entity> refuses to consider the request and sends out ravens , summoning the lords bannermen of the <entity class="NE" id=1649>North</entity> and their armies to assemble at <entity class="NE" id=1650>Winterfell</entity> . Released ravens fill the sky . At <entity class="NE" id=1651>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1652>Robb</entity> holds a feast for several of his newly-arrived bannermen . <entity class="NE" id=1653>Jon Umber</entity> assumes that he will lead the vanguard , and is offended by the suggestion that he would be made to march behind a Glover , threatening to withdraw from the host . In response , <entity class="NE" id=1654>Robb</entity> promises that , after the conflict with the <entity class="NE" id=1655>Lannisters</entity> , he will oust <entity class="NE" id=1656>Greatjon</entity> from his keep and hang him for breaking his oaths to <entity class="HSE" id=1657>House Stark</entity> ; when the enraged bannerman goes to draw a weapon , <entity class="NE" id=1654>Robb</entity> 's direwolf <entity class="NE" id=1658>Grey Wind</entity> sets upon him , biting off two of his fingers . <entity class="NE" id=1659>Robb</entity> recites 'that it [ is ] death to bear steel against your liege lord ' but then diffuses the situation by excusing <entity class="NE" id=1660>Greatjon</entity> 's aggression , saying that 'doubtless , the <entity class="NE" id=1660>Greatjon</entity> only meant to cut my meat for me ' . The <entity class="NE" id=1661>Greatjon</entity> roars with laughter and accepts <entity class="NE" id=1662>Robb</entity> 's commands , much to the shock of <entity class="NE" id=1663>Bran</entity> , who witnessed the entire incident . <entity class="NE" id=1664>Robb</entity> says farewell to <entity class="NE" id=1665>Bran</entity> and to <entity class="NE" id=1666>Rickon</entity> , who is convinced he 'll see neither Robb nor his parents again . <entity class="NE" id=1667>Bran</entity> prays by the heart tree when he is approached by <entity class="NE" id=1668>Osha</entity> who tells him the <entity class="NE" id=1669>Old Gods</entity> of the Forest are listening to him and that the wildlings also worship the <entity class="NE" id=1669>Old Gods</entity> . She laments that the <entity class="NE" id=1670>South</entity> has lost touch with the past ; the southern Weirwoods were cut down years ago and the Southerners have no idea what 's awakening in the north . They are interrupted by <entity class="NE" id=1671>Hodor</entity> who was bathing and has forgotten to put his clothes back on , and <entity class="NE" id=1672>Osha</entity> remarks that he might have giant blood in him before <entity class="NE" id=1673>Bran</entity> sends him away . <entity class="NE" id=1674>Curious</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1675>Bran</entity> asks her if giants live beyond the wall . She affirms they do , as well has many other beings , though not all of them are friendly . She asserts that the army <entity class="NE" id=1676>Robb</entity> has gathered should be marching north , not south . <entity class="NE" id=1677>Catelyn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1678>Ser Rodrik Cassel</entity> intercept <entity class="NE" id=1679>Robb</entity> 's army in the <entity class="NE" id=1680>Neck</entity> as it presses southwards . <entity class="NE" id=1681>Robb</entity> initially exclaims with excitement upon seeing his mother , but stops short of embracing her lest he look weak in front of his bannermen . <entity class="NE" id=1682>Catelyn</entity> looks at her son with understanding , later embracing once their liege-lords have left their tent . She tells Robb he has no choice but to go to war . However , he can not lose , for the sake of <entity class="NE" id=1683>Ned</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1684>Sansa</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=1685>Arya</entity> , as if he is defeated , <entity class="NE" id=1686>Tywin Lannister</entity> will show their family no mercy . Later on , <entity class="NE" id=1687>Robb</entity> and his lords are debating on the route of their march , and on whether to march directly against <entity class="NE" id=1688>Tywin</entity> 's army or against <entity class="NE" id=1689>Jaime</entity> 's army besieging Riverrun . To get to <entity class="NE" id=1690>Jaime</entity> , they need to cross the <entity class="NE" id=1691>Green Fork</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=1692>River Trident</entity> , and the only crossing is at the <entity class="NE" id=1693>Twins</entity> , held by the notoriously prickly and easily-offended <entity class="NE" id=1694>Lord Walder Frey</entity> . A Lannister scout is captured , and <entity class="NE" id=1695>Robb</entity> sends him back to warn <entity class="NE" id=1696>Lord Tywin</entity> that twenty thousand <entity class="NE" id=1697>Northern</entity> soldiers are marching against him . At the <entity class="NE" id=1698>Lannister Camp</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1699>Kevan</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1700>Tywin Lannister</entity> greet <entity class="NE" id=1701>Tyrion</entity> and his companions . <entity class="NE" id=1702>Tyrion</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1703>Bronn</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1704>Shagga</entity> and the rest of the hill tribesmen arrive at the <entity class="NE" id=1705>Lannister</entity> encampment , to find <entity class="NE" id=1706>Lord Tywin Lannister</entity> and his brother , <entity class="NE" id=1707>Ser Kevan</entity> , planning to engage the <entity class="NE" id=1708>Stark</entity> army , which is moving south from the <entity class="NE" id=1709>Neck</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1710>Tywin</entity> shows no sign of relief that his son is alive . <entity class="NE" id=1711>Tywin</entity> accepts the aid of the hill tribesmen , but <entity class="NE" id=1712>Shagga</entity> will only fight if <entity class="NE" id=1713>Tyrion</entity> fights alongside them , a prospect which <entity class="NE" id=1711>Tywin</entity> welcomes and terrifies Tyrion . Across the <entity class="NE" id=1714>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1715>Khal Khal</entity> disciplines <entity class="NE" id=1716>Mago</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1717>Daenerys</entity> notes <entity class="NE" id=1718>Drogo</entity> 's injury . In <entity class="NE" id=1719>Essos</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1720>Khal Drogo</entity> having taken an oath to take the <entity class="NE" id=1721>Iron Throne</entity> , has begun his march of conquest to the <entity class="NE" id=1722>Narrow Sea</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=1723>Dothraki</entity> raid a village in <entity class="NE" id=1724>Lhazar</entity> , a peaceful country to the south-east of <entity class="NE" id=1725>Vaes Dothrak</entity> . To finance the war to come , they must raid villages and take people to sell into slavery , thereby gaining the money to hire ships for the khalasar to assault <entity class="NE" id=1726>Westeros</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1727>Ser Ser</entity> and others try to explain this to <entity class="NE" id=1728>Daenerys</entity> , but she is disturbed to see the aftermath , the <entity class="NE" id=1729>Dothraki</entity> killing the villagers and raping their women , and orders it stopped . The <entity class="NE" id=1730>Dothraki</entity> grow angry at not being able to take the spoils of victory , as that is the <entity class="NE" id=1730>Dothraki</entity> way . She starts claiming all the women they see to protect them . The angry warriors take their complaints to <entity class="NE" id=1731>Khal Drogo</entity> , but he is amused at his wife 's fierceness . He tells them that <entity class="NE" id=1732>Daenerys</entity> may keep the women she has claimed , they can find others . One man wo n't listen , and angrily accuses <entity class="NE" id=1733>Drogo</entity> of being slave to a foreign whore . <entity class="NE" id=1734>Khal Khal</entity> stops the complaints by killing <entity class="NE" id=1735>Mago</entity> , the offended warrior who challenges him . <entity class="NE" id=1736>Drogo</entity> takes a deep wound to the chest in the process . Though <entity class="NE" id=1737>Drogo</entity> dismisses it as a scratch , <entity class="NE" id=1738>Daenerys</entity> insists it be treated and allows one of the women she rescued , a healer called <entity class="NE" id=1739>Mirri Maz Duur</entity> to treat the wound , despite the distaste of <entity class="NE" id=1737>Drogo</entity> 's bloodriders , who derisively call the woman maegi ( a witch ) . In <entity class="NE" id=1740>King</entity> 's Landing . Lannister soldiers complete their purge of the Stark guards and household staff . <entity class="NE" id=1741>Sansa</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1742>Septa Mordane</entity> hear sounds of fighting . When they are confronted by <entity class="NE" id=1743>Lannister</entity> guardsmen led by <entity class="NE" id=1744>Sandor Clegane</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1745>Septa Mordane</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=1746>Sansa</entity> to run and lock herself in her room while she stays to confront them . However , <entity class="NE" id=1747>Sandor</entity> later finds and takes <entity class="NE" id=1748>Sansa</entity> into custody . <entity class="NE" id=1749>Syrio Forel</entity> confronts <entity class="NE" id=1750>Ser Meryn Trant</entity> and Lannister guards . More Lannister guardsmen , this time led by <entity class="NE" id=1751>Ser Meryn Trant</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=1752>Kingsguard</entity> , interrupt a `` dancing '' lesson between <entity class="NE" id=1753>Syrio Forel</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1754>Arya</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1755>Syrio</entity> holds <entity class="NE" id=1756>Arya</entity> back , questioning why <entity class="NE" id=1757>Lord Eddard</entity> would send Lannister men to find <entity class="NE" id=1756>Arya</entity> . She then refuses to go with them , and when they try to force the issue Syrio disarms and disables all of the lightly-armored guardsmen with his wooden practice sword . He tells <entity class="NE" id=1758>Arya</entity> to run as he faces down Trant , noting that for himself , `` the <entity class="NE" id=1759>First Sword</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=1760>Braavos</entity> does not run . '' <entity class="NE" id=1761>Syrio</entity> 's fate after this is unclear . <entity class="NE" id=1762>Arya</entity> runs to the stables where the men waiting with their baggage were supposed to be to take them to the ship for <entity class="NE" id=1763>Winterfell</entity> . The men are dead , but she finds her real sword , <entity class="NE" id=1764>Needle</entity> , in the bottom of her trunk . <entity class="NE" id=1765>Arya</entity> then starts to leave the stables . ( <entity class="NE" id=1766>Arya</entity> knows how to get out of the <entity class="NE" id=1767>Red Keep</entity> via the tunnel under the castle that she found when she was chasing cats and followed the two conspirators ) . When a stableboy tries to grab her , <entity class="NE" id=1768>Arya</entity> turns around brandishing <entity class="NE" id=1769>Needle</entity> and accidentally runs him through and kills him . Horrified , she flees . <entity class="NE" id=1770>Varys</entity> visits <entity class="NE" id=1771>Eddard Stark</entity> in his cell in the dungeons . He is incredulous that <entity class="NE" id=1772>Eddard</entity> trusted Littlefinger over him , and even more so that he warned <entity class="NE" id=1773>Cersei</entity> what he was going to do . <entity class="NE" id=1774>Eddard</entity> says he wanted to extend mercy to <entity class="NE" id=1775>Cersei</entity> 's children , whom <entity class="NE" id=1776>Robert</entity> would have killed if he 'd known the truth . <entity class="NE" id=1777>Varys</entity> bluntly tells <entity class="NE" id=1778>Eddard</entity> that his mercy is what killed King <entity class="NE" id=1779>Robert</entity> , to <entity class="NE" id=1778>Eddard</entity> 's shame . <entity class="NE" id=1780>Varys</entity> then tells him that <entity class="NE" id=1781>Catelyn</entity> also no longer holds <entity class="NE" id=1782>Tyrion</entity> as her prisoner , meaning that the Starks have nothing to barter with for <entity class="NE" id=1783>Eddard</entity> 's life . When <entity class="NE" id=1784>Eddard</entity> suggests they should just kill him , <entity class="NE" id=1785>Varys</entity> says `` Not today , my lord . '' As he departs , <entity class="NE" id=1786>Eddard</entity> asks Varys who he truly serves : <entity class="NE" id=1787>Varys</entity> , in a rare display of honesty , replies `` The realm , my lord . <entity class="NE" id=1788>Someone</entity> must . `` . <entity class="NE" id=1789>Cersei</entity> and the remainder of the small council , comprised of <entity class="NE" id=1790>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1791>Varys</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=1792>Littlefinger</entity> , summon <entity class="NE" id=1793>Sansa</entity> to inform her that her father has been arrested for treason . They manipulate <entity class="NE" id=1794>Sansa</entity> into writing a letter to her brother <entity class="NE" id=1795>Robb</entity> , asking him to bend the knee peacefully to <entity class="NE" id=1796>Joffrey</entity> . They add that <entity class="NE" id=1797>Eddard</entity> 's fate may depend on what his son and the other <entity class="NE" id=1798>Northern</entity> lords do . <entity class="NE" id=1799>Sansa</entity> agrees to write the letter . Later on , King Joffrey holds court in the <entity class="NE" id=1800>Red Keep</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1801>Janos Janos</entity> , commander of the <entity class="NE" id=1802>City Watch</entity> , is to be made <entity class="NE" id=1803>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=1804>Harrenhal</entity> as a reward for his loyal service . <entity class="NE" id=1805>Cersei</entity> then dismisses <entity class="NE" id=1806>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> as head of the <entity class="NE" id=1807>Kingsguard</entity> , noting that the time has come for an honorable retirement . <entity class="NE" id=1808>Selmy</entity> is confused , pointing out that <entity class="NE" id=1809>Kingsguard</entity> serve for life , but <entity class="NE" id=1810>Joffrey</entity> angrily says that <entity class="NE" id=1808>Selmy</entity> is too old , and could n't protect his father . <entity class="NE" id=1811>Selmy</entity> 's disgrace is only compounded when he learns his post as <entity class="NE" id=1812>Lord Commander</entity> is to be given to <entity class="NE" id=1813>Jaime Lannister</entity> , much to his disgust . <entity class="NE" id=1814>Varys</entity> announces that <entity class="NE" id=1815>Selmy</entity> is to be given a castle and land in recognition of his years of service , but the old knight , insulted by what he sees as being offered `` a hall to die in and men to bury me , '' takes off his armor , throws his sword at <entity class="NE" id=1816>Joffrey</entity> 's feet and storms out , stating that he could still kill all five of the other <entity class="NE" id=1817>Kingsguard</entity> present with ease . <entity class="NE" id=1818>Sansa</entity> begs <entity class="NE" id=1819>Joffrey</entity> for her father 's life , claiming that the medicine he was taking for his injured leg was responsible for his treasonous talk . <entity class="NE" id=1820>Joffrey</entity> says that her sweet words have moved him and he will spare <entity class="NE" id=1821>Eddard</entity> , if he bends the knee to him and acknowledges him as king . <entity class="NE" id=1822>Sansa</entity> says he will .
