<entity class="NE" id=880>Tyrion</entity> 's predicament becomes common knowledge in <entity class="NE" id=881>King</entity> 's Landing , making life difficult for <entity class="NE" id=882>Eddard Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=883>Ned</entity> 's position is already precarious due to a disagreement with King <entity class="NE" id=884>Robert Baratheon</entity> over plans to assassinate <entity class="NE" id=885>Daenerys</entity> before she can rally the <entity class="NE" id=886>Dothraki</entity> to invade <entity class="NE" id=887>Westeros</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=888>Eyrie</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=889>Catelyn</entity> is shocked by her sister <entity class="NE" id=890>Lysa</entity> 's paranoia and distrust . In the <entity class="NE" id=891>Vale</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=892>Tyrion Lannister</entity> and his escorts in the hills of the <entity class="NE" id=891>Vale</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=892>Tyrion Lannister</entity> has his blindfold removed and finds that their party - augmented by several knights and the sellsword <entity class="NE" id=895>Bronn</entity> from the <entity class="NE" id=896>Crossroads Inn</entity> - is on the <entity class="NE" id=897>Eastern Road</entity> en route to the <entity class="NE" id=891>Vale</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=899>Arryn</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=889>Catelyn</entity> notes that she said they were riding for <entity class="NE" id=901>Winterfell</entity> often and loudly . <entity class="NE" id=880>Tyrion</entity> congratulates her on her cunning , while pointing out that his father will give out a handsome reward for his safe return ( a point that clearly piques <entity class="NE" id=895>Bronn</entity> 's interest ) . He also says that <entity class="NE" id=904>Lady Lysa Arryn</entity> has gone mad since her husband 's death and will try to kill him in the <entity class="NE" id=888>Eyrie</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=880>Tyrion</entity> also protests his innocence in the attempt on <entity class="NE" id=907>Bran</entity> 's life and points out he 'd have to be an idiot to give the assassin his own blade . Before <entity class="NE" id=889>Catelyn</entity> can answer , the party comes under attack from one of the hill tribes . Despite taking several losses , the party is able to drive off the attackers . Despite having the opportunity to escape , <entity class="NE" id=880>Tyrion</entity> fights , killing his first man during the skirmish , and in doing so saves <entity class="NE" id=889>Catelyn</entity> 's life . Afterwards , they resume their trek to the <entity class="NE" id=888>Eyrie</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=880>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=889>Catelyn</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=888>Eyrie</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=915>High Hall</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=915>High Hall</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=888>Eyrie</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=904>Lady Lysa Arryn</entity> holds court on behalf of her young son , <entity class="NE" id=919>Robin</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=890>Lysa</entity> is furious that <entity class="NE" id=921>Cat</entity> has endangered them all by bringing <entity class="NE" id=880>Tyrion</entity> to the <entity class="NE" id=891>Vale</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=880>Tyrion</entity> points out that if he is harmed , there will be war with <entity class="HSE" id=925>House Lannister</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=890>Lysa</entity> is unconcerned about his threats , as the <entity class="NE" id=891>Vale</entity> is strongly-defended and the <entity class="NE" id=888>Eyrie</entity> is impregnable . She orders him sent to the sky cells , three-sided cells with the fourth open to a sheer drop down the mountainside , forcing <entity class="NE" id=880>Tyrion</entity> to huddle in a corner and try not to roll out to his death in his sleep . In the <entity class="NE" id=930>North</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=901>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=907>Bran</entity> is angry about his mother 's absence . <entity class="NE" id=933>Maester Maester</entity> tries to set his mind at rest about the matter , to no avail . However , when <entity class="NE" id=907>Bran</entity> gets frustrated at not being able to practice his archery , <entity class="NE" id=935>Luwin</entity> suggests that he could learn to use a shortbow , of the kind used in mounted combat by the <entity class="NE" id=886>Dothraki</entity> , a notion which pleases <entity class="NE" id=907>Bran</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=907>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=938>Maester Luwin</entity> discuss geography . Elsewhere in the castle , <entity class="NE" id=939>Theon Greyjoy</entity> enjoys the attentions of his favorite whore , <entity class="NE" id=940>Ros</entity> , but becomes annoyed when she compares his prowess unfavorably to that of <entity class="NE" id=892>Tyrion Lannister</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=881>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=943>Lord Lord</entity> arrives at the tourney ground to speak to <entity class="NE" id=944>Lord Commander Barristan Selmy</entity> about the death of <entity class="NE" id=945>Ser Hugh</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=891>Vale</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=947>Barristan</entity> notes that he had no family or friends so he stood the knight 's vigil himself for <entity class="NE" id=945>Ser Hugh</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> is suspicious of <entity class="NE" id=945>Ser Hugh</entity> 's death , wanting to know how he could afford a new set of armor so soon after being made a knight . <entity class="NE" id=947>Barristan</entity> reflects on the irony of them being on opposite sides of the war during <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> 's Rebellion and now they are working together . Ser Ser and <entity class="NE" id=953>Lord Eddard Stark</entity> discuss the death of <entity class="NE" id=945>Ser Hugh</entity> . He also tells <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> that King <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> is planning to joust during the day 's activities . <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> finds King <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> tormenting his squire , <entity class="NE" id=959>Lancel Lannister</entity> , finally sending him off on a snipe hunt in amused disgust . <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> is adamant about fighting in the joust but <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> tells him that he is too fat for his armor and the other knights would let him win . <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> is forced to admit that he 's right but they can at least watch the joust from the stands . The first tilt of the day is between the fearsome <entity class="NE" id=963>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=964>Mountain</entity> , and the popular 'Knight of the <entity class="NE" id=965>Flowers</entity> ' , <entity class="NE" id=966>Ser Loras Tyrell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=967>Loras</entity> gives a beautiful flower to <entity class="NE" id=968>Sansa Stark</entity> , while <entity class="NE" id=969>Littlefinger</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=970>Lord Renly</entity> make a wager on who will win with <entity class="NE" id=971>Renly</entity> betting on <entity class="NE" id=967>Loras</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=967>Loras</entity> is riding a mare that is in-heat , which confuses the <entity class="NE" id=964>Mountain</entity> 's horse , causing him to throw his rider . King <entity class="NE" id=884>Robert Baratheon</entity> is dismayed to find he no longer fits his armor . Enraged at having lost , <entity class="NE" id=975>Gregor</entity> first decapitates his horse and then attacks <entity class="NE" id=976>Ser Loras</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=977>Sandor Sandor</entity> comes to <entity class="NE" id=967>Loras</entity> ' defense , preventing his brother from killing him . They exchange several blows , until King <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> orders them to cease . <entity class="NE" id=980>Sandor</entity> immediately bows to the king , while <entity class="NE" id=975>Gregor</entity> storms off the field . Ser Ser declares <entity class="NE" id=980>Sandor</entity> the victor of the match to the <entity class="NE" id=983>Hound</entity> 's discomfort . In the <entity class="NE" id=984>Red Keep</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=985>Lord Varys</entity> meets with <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> tells him that the king is a fool and will soon be dead unless <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> can save him . <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> wants to know why <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> is telling him this now . <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> tells him he had to be sure <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> could be trusted . He calls <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> an honorable and true man , maybe the only one in the city . He also confirms that <entity class="NE" id=994>Jon Arryn</entity> was assassinated with a poison called the Tears of <entity class="NE" id=995>Lys</entity> because he `` started asking questions '' . <entity class="NE" id=996>Arya</entity> is chasing cats in accordance with her sword training . She chases one into the dungeons under the castle , where she finds the great dragon skulls of the <entity class="NE" id=997>Targaryens</entity> in storage . She hears two men - <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=999>Magister Illyrio Mopatis</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=1000>Pentos</entity> - talking . <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> says that events have been set in motion and the lion and the wolf will soon be at each other 's throats . War is almost upon the <entity class="NE" id=1002>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , as they planned , but it has come too soon . <entity class="NE" id=1003>Khal Khal</entity> will not invade <entity class="NE" id=887>Westeros</entity> until his son is born and pronounced healthy , which is still many months away . <entity class="NE" id=1005>Illyrio</entity> suggests assassinating <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> to forestall the war , but <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> refuses . <entity class="NE" id=980>Sandor</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1009>Ser Gregor</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=976>Ser Loras</entity> at the tournament . Afterwards , <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> finds Littlefinger in the <entity class="NE" id=1012>Great Hall</entity> staring at the <entity class="NE" id=1013>Iron Throne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> reveals that he knows about <entity class="NE" id=969>Littlefinger</entity> 's assistance in <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> 's investigation of <entity class="NE" id=994>Jon Arryn</entity> 's death and reminds Littlefinger of the consequences that may befall him should the <entity class="NE" id=1018>Lannisters</entity> discover his involvement . In response , <entity class="NE" id=969>Littlefinger</entity> reveals that he already knows about <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> having met with both <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1005>Illyrio</entity> just earlier that day , implying he knows of <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> ' allegiances across the <entity class="NE" id=1023>Narrow Sea</entity> . Their conversation is interrupted by <entity class="NE" id=971>Renly</entity> , who informs them that <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> will be joining them at their small council meeting . <entity class="NE" id=996>Arya</entity> escapes from the dungeon and tries to warn her father about what she overheard but she gets the words muddled up . They are interrupted by <entity class="NE" id=1027>Yoren</entity> , who has ridden non-stop from the <entity class="NE" id=896>Crossroads Inn</entity> to bring <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> forewarning of <entity class="NE" id=889>Catelyn</entity> 's arrest of <entity class="NE" id=892>Tyrion Lannister</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> keeps the information to himself , while <entity class="NE" id=996>Arya</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=1034>Jory Cassel</entity> about the state of her father 's household guard . <entity class="NE" id=1035>Jory</entity> tells her she does not have to worry about her father 's safety . At the meeting of the small council , King <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=1038>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> is pregnant and her son will have a claim to the <entity class="NE" id=1013>Iron Throne</entity> . He wants <entity class="NE" id=885>Daenerys</entity> , the unborn child , and <entity class="NE" id=1041>Viserys</entity> dead as soon as possible . <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> secretly meets <entity class="NE" id=1005>Illyrio</entity> under the <entity class="NE" id=984>Red Keep</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> states that this act would be dishonorable , cowardly , and beneath their dignity . The other members of the council - <entity class="NE" id=1046>Pycelle</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=971>Renly</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=969>Littlefinger</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=987>Varys</entity> - all concur that <entity class="NE" id=885>Daenerys</entity> must die for the good of the realm . King <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> orders <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> to enact the order . He refuses and resigns as the <entity class="NE" id=1053>Hand</entity> of the King , to <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> 's utter disbelief and fury . <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> orders his household to begin packing . As <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> is packing , <entity class="NE" id=969>Littlefinger</entity> arrives and offers to take <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> to the last place <entity class="NE" id=994>Jon Arryn</entity> went before he `` fell ill '' . <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> agrees . Ser Ser and <entity class="NE" id=970>Lord Renly</entity> , who are lovers , meet in a bedchamber . Renly complains as <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> is organizing a hunt in the <entity class="NE" id=1062>Kingswood</entity> , which will no doubt involve traipsing around the forest for a couple of weeks in the cold and rain waiting to kill some animal . <entity class="NE" id=967>Loras</entity> urges Renly to claim the crown himself , offering him the allegiance of his rich and powerful family . Renly dismisses the notion , since he is fourth in line to the <entity class="NE" id=1013>Iron Throne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=967>Loras</entity> points out that <entity class="NE" id=1066>Joffrey</entity> is a monster , that <entity class="NE" id=1067>Tommen</entity> is only eight and laughs at the notion of <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=971>Renly</entity> 's other brother , <entity class="NE" id=1070>Lord Stannis</entity> , ever becoming king , as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster . He also asserts that the people love Renly and want to serve him because he is kind and does n't revel in violence as his brothers do . Queen <entity class="NE" id=1071>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> share a rare drink and discussion about the <entity class="NE" id=1073>Targaryen</entity> threat . Surprisingly , <entity class="NE" id=1071>Cersei</entity> takes <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> 's side , pointing out that the <entity class="NE" id=886>Dothraki</entity> can not cross the <entity class="NE" id=1023>Narrow Sea</entity> as they have no ships . Ser Ser urges Renly to consider his place in the line of succession . <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> agrees , but if they land and the knights of <entity class="NE" id=887>Westeros</entity> take shelter behind their castle walls , the <entity class="NE" id=886>Dothraki</entity> could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the smallfolk accept Viserys as their king regardless . <entity class="NE" id=1071>Cersei</entity> suggests that the unified armies of the <entity class="NE" id=1002>Seven Kingdoms</entity> could defeat them but <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> says she underestimates the skill and ability of one army with one leader and one purpose as compared to that of the scattered and patchwork armies of <entity class="NE" id=887>Westeros</entity> . Their discussion moves to <entity class="NE" id=1085>Lyanna Stark</entity> , which surprises <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> , as in seventeen years <entity class="NE" id=1071>Cersei</entity> has never asked about her . He tells her that <entity class="NE" id=1088>Lyanna</entity> 's death left in him a void that seven kingdoms could not fill . He also tells her that their marriage never had a chance of success because of the hold <entity class="NE" id=1088>Lyanna</entity> 's memory has on him , and bitterly adds he can barely remember what she looked like . <entity class="NE" id=1071>Cersei</entity> says that she felt something for <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> once , even after they lost their first boy , for quite a while . She asks <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> if there was ever any chance for their marriage and he answers `` No '' . <entity class="NE" id=969>Littlefinger</entity> brings <entity class="NE" id=882>Eddard Stark</entity> to the last place <entity class="NE" id=994>Jon Arryn</entity> went before falling ill , which is one of <entity class="NE" id=1096>Littefinger</entity> 's brothels . There <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> meets another one of <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> 's bastards , this time a girl , and her mother , a blond whore named <entity class="NE" id=1099>Mhaegen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1099>Mhaegen</entity> remarks that her child has <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> 's nose and `` black '' hair . <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> asks Littlefinger why <entity class="NE" id=994>Jon Arryn</entity> was searching for <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> 's bastards but he says he does n't know , offering the half-hearted guess that maybe <entity class="NE" id=952>Robert</entity> suddenly took paternal interest in them . <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> looks skeptical of that reason . Leaving the brothel , <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=1034>Jory Cassel</entity> , and the two guards that accompanied them are confronted by a large group of Lannister guardsmen led by <entity class="NE" id=1108>Ser Jaime Lannister</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1109>Jaime</entity> has heard of <entity class="NE" id=880>Tyrion</entity> 's arrest and demands an explanation . <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=880>Tyrion</entity> was arrested on his orders . <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> is stabbed through the leg by a Lannister guardsman . Jaime threatens to kill <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> but <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> points out that if he does , <entity class="NE" id=880>Tyrion</entity> will die as well . <entity class="NE" id=1109>Jaime</entity> acknowledges that this is true , so he says he will settle for killing <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> 's men instead . There is a brief engagement in which <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> 's two guards , <entity class="NE" id=1119>Heward</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1120>Wyl</entity> , are killed by <entity class="NE" id=1121>Lannister</entity> spearmen . In response , <entity class="NE" id=883>Ned</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=1035>Jory</entity> fight and kill five of the <entity class="NE" id=1121>Lannister</entity> soldiers . <entity class="NE" id=1035>Jory</entity> engages Jaime but is quickly killed when <entity class="NE" id=1109>Jaime</entity> stabs him through the eye with a dagger . <entity class="NE" id=1127>Furious</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> crosses swords with <entity class="NE" id=1109>Jaime</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=1109>Jaime</entity> is shocked and then exhilarated when the older Ned is not as easily defeated as he expected . However , <entity class="NE" id=1109>Jaime</entity> gradually starts to grow worried as <entity class="NE" id=883>Ned</entity> 's high level of skill becomes apparent . Just as they are ready to clash again , a Lannister guardsman steps in and stabs <entity class="NE" id=949>Eddard</entity> through the leg with a spear , disabling him . <entity class="NE" id=1109>Jaime</entity> is annoyed at the dishonorable interruption and knocks out the guardsman . He departs , telling Eddard he wants his brother back .
