As tragic news spreads across the <entity class="NE" id=2029>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2030>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2031>Rickon</entity> share a prophetic dream , <entity class="NE" id=2032>Catelyn</entity> interrogates <entity class="NE" id=2033>Jaime</entity> about her sonʼs fall , and <entity class="NE" id=2034>Robbʼs</entity> destiny is forever changed . After a surprising decision by his father , <entity class="NE" id=2035>Tyrion</entity> heads south . <entity class="NE" id=2036>Arya</entity> assumes a new identity in an attempt to escape <entity class="NE" id=2037>King</entity> 's Landing , and <entity class="NE" id=2038>Sansa</entity> is terrorized by <entity class="NE" id=2039>Joffrey</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=2040>Wall</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2041>Jon</entity> is forced to choose between the <entity class="NE" id=2042>Nightʼs Watch</entity> and the family he left behind . Across the sea , <entity class="NE" id=2043>Dany</entity> pays a terrible price for her love , but finds new hope through her dragon eggs . In <entity class="NE" id=2037>King</entity> 's Landing . At the <entity class="NE" id=2045>Great Sept</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=2046>Baelor</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2047>Eddard Stark</entity> has been executed by beheading ; The great sword Ice is covered in blood , and <entity class="NE" id=2048>Sandor Clegane</entity> standing next to <entity class="NE" id=2049>Ser Ilyn Payne</entity> , the royal executioner , holds <entity class="NE" id=2050>Lord Eddard</entity> 's head up to the adulation of the baying crowd . <entity class="NE" id=2051>Sansa Sansa</entity> has fainted . In the crowd , <entity class="NE" id=2052>Yoren</entity> drags <entity class="NE" id=2036>Arya</entity> away , making a point of calling her `` Boy '' . Once he gets her out of the courtyard , he cuts her hair off with a knife . He tells her that he will get her out of <entity class="NE" id=2037>King</entity> 's Landing and to <entity class="NE" id=2055>Winterfell</entity> as a recruit of the <entity class="NE" id=2056>Night's Watch</entity> , but he warns her not to trust the other recruits , since apparently half would hand her over to <entity class="NE" id=2057>Cersei</entity> for a pardon , while the other half would do the same , but only after raping her first . <entity class="NE" id=2039>Joffrey</entity> is holding court and a singer is brought before him , charged with making up an amusing but offensive song about <entity class="NE" id=2059>Robert</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2057>Cersei</entity> . The song says that the boar might have killed King <entity class="NE" id=2059>Robert</entity> , but the lion in his bed had previously castrated him . The singer turns out to be <entity class="NE" id=2062>Marillion</entity> , who <entity class="NE" id=2032>Catelyn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2064>Ser Rodrik</entity> met at the <entity class="NE" id=2065>Inn</entity> at the <entity class="NE" id=2066>Crossroads</entity> , and who accompanied them and <entity class="NE" id=2035>Tyrion</entity> to the <entity class="NE" id=2068>Vale</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=2069>Arryn</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2039>Joffrey</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=2062>Marillion</entity> if he wants to keep his hands or tongue . <entity class="NE" id=2062>Marillion</entity> fearfully responds that everyone needs hands . <entity class="NE" id=2039>Joffrey</entity> commands <entity class="NE" id=2074>Ilyn Payne</entity> to cut out the tongue instead . <entity class="NE" id=2039>Joffrey</entity> then takes <entity class="NE" id=2038>Sansa</entity> up to the walls to see her father 's head and makes her look at it . He cruelly mocks her , promising he will give her <entity class="NE" id=2077>Robb</entity> 's head next . <entity class="NE" id=2038>Sansa</entity> quietly retorts that <entity class="NE" id=2077>Robb</entity> might give her <entity class="NE" id=2039>Joffrey</entity> 's instead . Infuriated , <entity class="NE" id=2039>Joffrey</entity> orders <entity class="NE" id=2082>Ser Meryn Trant</entity> to beat her , as <entity class="NE" id=2057>Cersei</entity> has told him that a king should not hit his queen . <entity class="NE" id=2038>Sansa</entity> moves up behind <entity class="NE" id=2039>Joffrey</entity> , apparently preparing to shove him off the walkway to his death , but unexpectedly <entity class="NE" id=2048>Sandor Clegane</entity> dabs the blood off her lip with a handkerchief and after <entity class="NE" id=2039>Joffrey</entity> leaves , tells her to give him what he wants . <entity class="NE" id=2087>Lancel</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2057>Cersei</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2089>Cersei Cersei</entity> has taken a new lover , her cousin <entity class="NE" id=2087>Lancel</entity> who was King <entity class="NE" id=2059>Robert</entity> 's squire . She also receives a letter informing her of <entity class="NE" id=2033>Jaime</entity> 's capture . <entity class="NE" id=2087>Lancel</entity> is naked in <entity class="NE" id=2057>Cersei</entity> 's bedroom . The thought of being at war is exciting to him , as he has just been made a new young knight . He asks for the news of the war and asks what their next move is , but <entity class="NE" id=2057>Cersei</entity> tells him to shut up and get back in bed . <entity class="NE" id=2096>Grand Grand</entity> takes the prostitute <entity class="NE" id=2097>Ros</entity> to bed , revealing that he is actually far less frail than he appears . He boasts to <entity class="NE" id=2097>Ros</entity> of the several great kings he has served , lamenting first how <entity class="NE" id=2099>Aerys Targaryen</entity> devolved from a charming young man into a paranoid lunatic obsessed with fire , how <entity class="NE" id=2100>Robert Baratheon</entity> was a great soldier , but perhaps not so ideal a king , before displaying his sycophantic loyalty to <entity class="NE" id=2039>Joffrey</entity> . Yoren and <entity class="NE" id=2036>Arya</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2052>Yoren</entity> has assembled a band of new recruits for the <entity class="NE" id=2056>Night's Watch</entity> . Pretending that Arya is a boy called `` <entity class="NE" id=2105>Arry</entity> '' , he has her join the group . Also in the group are <entity class="NE" id=2106>Hot Pie</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2107>Lommy Greenhands</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=2108>Gendry</entity> , who unknown to him , is King <entity class="NE" id=2059>Robert</entity> 's bastard son . He had been working for <entity class="NE" id=2110>Tobho Mott</entity> , but with <entity class="NE" id=2059>Robert</entity> dead , the secret funds being sent to <entity class="NE" id=2112>Mott</entity> stopped , so he fired <entity class="NE" id=2108>Gendry</entity> and told him he had to join the <entity class="NE" id=2056>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2115>Hot Hot</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2116>Lommy</entity> try to bully <entity class="NE" id=2036>Arya</entity> into giving up <entity class="NE" id=2118>Needle</entity> , but she angrily draws the sword , warning that she `` has already killed one fat boy '' and will happily do it again . <entity class="NE" id=2108>Gendry</entity> breaks up the argument by taking <entity class="NE" id=2036>Arya</entity> 's side , threatening the boys with violence to keep them from picking on <entity class="NE" id=2036>Arya</entity> later . <entity class="NE" id=2052>Yoren</entity> now has to get them all to the <entity class="NE" id=2040>Wall</entity> , a thousand leagues away , through the war-torn Riverlands . They set out . In the <entity class="NE" id=2123>North</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=2055>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2030>Bran</entity> has another dream of the three-eyed raven . He wakes up and tells Osha about how the dream always ends with the bird flying into the crypts under the castle , and he tells her he thinks his father is in the tombs . <entity class="NE" id=2126>Osha</entity> takes <entity class="NE" id=2030>Bran</entity> down there , and <entity class="NE" id=2030>Bran</entity> tells her about the histories of some of the ancestors entombed there . They are then surprised by <entity class="NE" id=2128>Shaggydog</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2031>Rickon</entity> 's direwolf , who leaps out at them from the empty future tomb of <entity class="NE" id=2047>Eddard Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2031>Rickon</entity> calls <entity class="NE" id=2128>Shaggydog</entity> off , then reveals to Bran that he had the same dream . Making their way out , <entity class="NE" id=2126>Osha</entity> is still trying to tell <entity class="NE" id=2030>Bran</entity> that it could be a coincidence , but outside they see <entity class="NE" id=2135>Maester Luwin</entity> , who holds a letter and looks at them with such sadness that it is obviously the news of <entity class="NE" id=2136>Eddard</entity> 's death . In the <entity class="NE" id=2137>Riverlands</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2032>Catelyn</entity> comforts her son , promising to avenge <entity class="NE" id=2136>Eddard</entity> 's death At <entity class="NE" id=2077>Robb</entity> 's camp , <entity class="NE" id=2032>Catelyn</entity> stoically walks through the encampment and receives the condolences and respect of the northern bannermen , who bow to her as she passes . She makes her way into the woods around the camp . Once she is out of everyone 's sight , she breaks down , practically hyperventilating with grief . Hearing something from deeper in the woods , she finds <entity class="NE" id=2077>Robb</entity> hacking his sword at a tree in anger and grief . <entity class="NE" id=2142>Lady Lady</entity> calls to him and tells him he is ruining his sword . <entity class="NE" id=2077>Robb</entity> drops the sword and falls into her arms , vowing to kill the Lannisters who murdered his father . <entity class="NE" id=2032>Catelyn</entity> comforts him and promises him revenge , but only after they rescue <entity class="NE" id=2038>Sansa</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2036>Arya</entity> first . At <entity class="NE" id=2077>Robb</entity> 's camp , <entity class="NE" id=2077>Robb</entity> and his bannermen debate what to do in the war against King Joffrey . They debate whether to align with <entity class="NE" id=2148>Stannis</entity> or <entity class="NE" id=2149>Renly Baratheon</entity> , but there is no agreement as <entity class="NE" id=2150>Renly</entity> has greater forces , but <entity class="NE" id=2148>Stannis</entity> is elder and next in line of succession ( if <entity class="NE" id=2057>Cersei</entity> 's children are discounted ) . <entity class="NE" id=2152>Jon Umber</entity> becomes irritated and questions why the northerners should be told what to do by rulers in the south at all , reminding them that the <entity class="NE" id=2123>North</entity> was once independent of the other Kingdoms before the <entity class="NE" id=2154>Targaryens</entity> threatened them with their dragons . With the dragons gone , <entity class="NE" id=2155>Umber</entity> declares there is only one king worthy of his respect and allegiance and bows before <entity class="NE" id=2077>Robb</entity> , calling out , `` The King in the <entity class="NE" id=2123>North</entity> ! '' The other northern bannermen take up the cry and bow before the new King in the <entity class="NE" id=2123>North</entity> , swearing fealty to <entity class="NE" id=2077>Robb</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2032>Catelyn</entity> visits the captive Jaime Lannister who taunts her about <entity class="NE" id=2161>Ned</entity> 's death and offers to serve her as a lover . She hits him in the head with a rock . <entity class="NE" id=2033>Jaime</entity> says that if she keeps hitting him , she can kill him and that he does n't fear death , though <entity class="NE" id=2033>Jaime</entity> probably realizes that the <entity class="NE" id=2163>Starks</entity> wo n't kill him as long as his sister holds <entity class="NE" id=2038>Sansa</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2036>Arya</entity> hostage . <entity class="NE" id=2032>Catelyn</entity> tells him he has violated the laws of man and gods , and he asks where <entity class="NE" id=2161>Ned</entity> 's gods were when his head was cut off ( he questions the existence of all gods , the <entity class="NE" id=2168>Old</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=2169>New</entity> ) . She says injustice in the world is because of men like him . <entity class="NE" id=2033>Jaime</entity> responds , `` There are no men like me , only me '' . He admits to pushing <entity class="NE" id=2030>Bran</entity> from the tower , but does n't reveal why . At the <entity class="NE" id=2172>Lannister</entity> camp , <entity class="NE" id=2173>Lord Tywin</entity> is holding a strategy meeting with his generals , and is furious that <entity class="NE" id=2033>Jaime</entity> has been captured by the <entity class="NE" id=2163>Starks</entity> . Both Stannis and Renly have claimed the <entity class="NE" id=2176>Iron Throne</entity> , meaning the <entity class="NE" id=2177>Lannisters</entity> are now faced with fighting a two-front war against the <entity class="NE" id=2163>Starks</entity> to the north and the <entity class="NE" id=2179>Baratheons</entity> to the south . <entity class="NE" id=2180>Tywin</entity> 's commanders are uncertain what to do , arguing about whether to strike while they still can , fall back and raise reinforcement armies , or sue for peace . <entity class="NE" id=2035>Tyrion</entity> points out that any chance of negotiating with <entity class="NE" id=2182>Robb Stark</entity> died when his father <entity class="NE" id=2136>Eddard</entity> was executed . The <entity class="NE" id=2172>Lannister</entity> army is now exposed , so <entity class="NE" id=2180>Tywin</entity> decides to retreat to <entity class="NE" id=2186>Harrenhal</entity> , the great castle on the northern shores of <entity class="NE" id=2187>Gods Eye</entity> , and use it as a base of operations . Reluctantly impressed by <entity class="NE" id=2035>Tyrion</entity> 's astute judgment of the situation , <entity class="NE" id=2180>Tywin</entity> orders his son to go to <entity class="NE" id=2037>King</entity> 's Landing and serve as Acting Hand of the King in <entity class="NE" id=2180>Tywin</entity> 's stead . He is to bring <entity class="NE" id=2057>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2039>Joffrey</entity> to heel and prevent the young king from making more idiotic mistakes . <entity class="NE" id=2180>Tywin</entity> also tells him to deal with <entity class="NE" id=2194>Baelish</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2195>Varys</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=2196>Pycelle</entity> if he gets so much as a hint of treachery from any of them . He also orders Tyrion to leave his whore behind . Later on in his tent , <entity class="NE" id=2035>Tyrion</entity> complains about his father to <entity class="NE" id=2198>Shae</entity> , then decides to defy <entity class="NE" id=2180>Tywin</entity> and take <entity class="NE" id=2198>Shae</entity> to court anyway . At the <entity class="NE" id=2040>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2201>Jon Jon</entity> learns of his father 's death . He saddles a horse and prepares to leave to join <entity class="NE" id=2077>Robb</entity> 's army , ignoring <entity class="NE" id=2203>Samwell</entity> 's pleas to stay and fulfill his oaths . <entity class="NE" id=2041>Jon</entity> leaves <entity class="NE" id=2205>Castle Black</entity> , but is pursued . One of his pursuers hits a tree branch and is unhorsed , and <entity class="NE" id=2041>Jon</entity> realizes it was <entity class="NE" id=2207>Sam</entity> . He turns back to help him . The other riders are <entity class="NE" id=2208>Grenn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2209>Pypar</entity> . He tells them to go back or they will get in trouble too , but they say they ca n't go back without him . They surround him and recite their oath to the <entity class="NE" id=2056>Night's Watch</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=2041>Jon</entity> realizes they are right : leaving would make him a deserter and oathbreaker , something his father would never countenance if he were alive , and <entity class="NE" id=2041>Jon</entity> does n't even know if <entity class="NE" id=2077>Robb</entity> would accept his help or turn him over to the authorities . He agrees to return to the <entity class="NE" id=2040>Wall</entity> with them . <entity class="NE" id=2214>Lord Lord</entity> decides to overlook <entity class="NE" id=2041>Jon</entity> 's brief desertion , saying many have fled the <entity class="NE" id=2040>Wall</entity> , only to think better of it and return . If they executed everyone who did that , they 'd have no men left . <entity class="NE" id=2217>Mormont</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=2041>Jon</entity> that the war between the <entity class="NE" id=2177>Lannisters</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2163>Starks</entity> is less important than what they face now , a renewed threat from the wildlings , <entity class="NE" id=2221>White Walkers</entity> , and wights . <entity class="NE" id=2217>Mormont</entity> means to lead the <entity class="NE" id=2223>Night</entity> 's Watch in force into the <entity class="NE" id=2224>Haunted Forest</entity> to learn more of their foe , to prepare to battle against them , and to find the missing <entity class="NE" id=2225>Benjen Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2041>Jon</entity> agrees to commit himself fully to the <entity class="NE" id=2056>Night's Watch</entity> and all that lies ahead . Across the <entity class="NE" id=2228>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> regains consciousness . In the wastelands beyond <entity class="NE" id=2230>Lhazar</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> wakes up to terrible news from <entity class="NE" id=2232>Ser Jorah Mormont</entity> . Her son , <entity class="NE" id=2233>Rhaego</entity> , is dead . He was born dead and deformed , covered with scales . The majority of the khalasar has also moved on , leaving them behind . However , <entity class="NE" id=2234>Drogo</entity> lives . <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> insists on seeing her husband , and finds him a catatonic vegetable . <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> demands to know why , and <entity class="NE" id=2237>Mirri Maz Duur</entity> explains that when <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> `` saved '' her , she had already been raped three times and the temple she served had been burned and defiled by the <entity class="NE" id=2238>Dothraki</entity> . They had sacked her village , looted all they owned , and those not killed were enslaved . She has now gotten her revenge , not only on <entity class="NE" id=2234>Drogo</entity> , but on <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> ' child <entity class="NE" id=2233>Rhaego</entity> ; now her `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' can burn no cities and slaughter no innocents . <entity class="NE" id=2242>Duur</entity> agrees that <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> saved her life , but she says to ask <entity class="NE" id=2234>Drogo</entity> what life is worth when all else is gone . It is night , and <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> is in their tent tending to <entity class="NE" id=2234>Drogo</entity> . She baths him , talks to him , even tries to seduce him , but nothing she does reaches him . She realizes he is no longer there , and seeing him in his vegetative state breaks her heart . <entity class="NE" id=2247>Crying</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> kisses him goodbye , then smothers him with a pillow . <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> and her small retinue prepare a funeral pyre for <entity class="NE" id=2234>Drogo</entity> . She makes a speech to the few who are left saying that if they wish to go they may , but if they stay with her she will lead them into a glorious future . She frees those of them who are slaves and asks that they stay as equals . The maegi smirks as some people begin walking away . At <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> ' command , <entity class="NE" id=2252>Rakharo</entity> places the dragon eggs on the pyre , and <entity class="NE" id=2237>Mirri Maz Duur</entity> is tied to a stake next to the pyre as well . She tells Daenerys that she will not scream while she is burned alive . <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> replies that she only wants the maegi 's life . Ser Ser believes that <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> intends to kill herself and pleads for her to reconsider , as they can sell the eggs and travel far away . Ignoring <entity class="NE" id=2256>Jorah</entity> 's pleas , she kisses his cheek , and sets the pyre alight . <entity class="NE" id=2257>Mirri Mirri</entity> does indeed scream as she burns , and <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> calmly walks into the flames . She stands below the pyre as flames appear to consume her . At dawn , the fire dies down . <entity class="NE" id=2256>Jorah</entity> and the rest of the khalasar awake to find <entity class="NE" id=2229>Daenerys</entity> sitting among the still smoldering embers , with three newly-hatched baby dragons crawling over her . Her clothes have burnt away and her body is covered in ash , but she is completely unharmed . One dragon nuzzles in her arm , another climbs her leg , and the third pulls itself up to sit on her shoulder . At the sight of the mythical animals born anew , an amazed <entity class="NE" id=2256>Jorah</entity> and the few remaining <entity class="NE" id=2238>Dothraki</entity> kneel and swear their allegiance to the Mother of <entity class="NE" id=2263>Dragons</entity> . After she slowly stands up from the ashes , the black hatchling on her shoulder rises , spreads its wings and screams , announcing the return of dragons to the world .
