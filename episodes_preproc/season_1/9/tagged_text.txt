With <entity id=1823>Sansaʼs</entity> life in danger , <entity id=1824>Ned</entity> makes a fateful decision . <entity id=1825>Catelyn</entity> brokers an unsavory deal with the slippery <entity id=1826>Walder Frey</entity> . <entity id=1827>Tyrion</entity> acquires a mistress and is forced by his father to fight on the front lines . <entity id=1828>Robb</entity> wins his first major victory and captures a prized prisoner . <entity id=1829>Jon</entity> is rewarded for his valor and discovers a dark secret about <entity id=1830>Maester Aemon</entity> . As <entity id=1831>Khal Drogoʼs</entity> wound festers , <entity id=1832>Daenerys</entity> defies his bloodrider <entity id=1833>Qotho</entity> and puts her trust in the enslaved witch <entity id=1834>Mirri Maz Duur</entity> . In the <entity id=1835>Riverlands</entity> . <entity id=1836>Theon</entity> and <entity id=1837>Robb</entity> outside the <entity id=1838>Twins</entity> . <entity id=1839>Robb</entity> 's army has reached the <entity id=1840>Twins</entity> , the heavily-fortified crossing over the <entity id=1841>Green Fork</entity> of <entity id=1842>Trident River</entity> . Theon <entity id=1843>Greyjoy</entity> shoots down messenger ravens , so no word of their presence can be relayed , but finds nothing more but messages to extended family members . To enter the castle would be perilous for <entity id=1844>Robb</entity> , so <entity id=1845>Catelyn Stark</entity> enters to negotiate their crossing the river . Though held by <entity id=1846>House Frey</entity> , bannermen to <entity id=1847>Catelyn Stark</entity> 's father , <entity id=1848>Lord Walder Frey</entity> has not yet taken up arms . When called up , he says he had been preparing to march , and was just waiting for all his forces to arrive . In reality , he waited to see which side was winning before deciding whether to get involved . Now , as the <entity id=1849>Tully</entity> 's army has been defeated and <entity id=1850>Riverrun</entity> is held by the <entity id=1851>Lannisters</entity> , he wants to know why he should be helping <entity id=1852>Robb</entity> and taking up arms against the king . After some hard bargaining between <entity id=1853>Catelyn</entity> and <entity id=1854>Walder</entity> , they strike a deal : the <entity id=1855>Freys</entity> will join <entity id=1856>Robb</entity> 's cause , allow him to cross and commit troops to his army , but in return both <entity id=1856>Robb</entity> and <entity id=1857>Arya</entity> must each marry one of <entity id=1854>Walder</entity> 's own children . <entity id=1858>Robb</entity> agrees , though noting that <entity id=1859>Arya</entity> wo n't like it . <entity id=1860>Robb</entity> must also take <entity id=1861>Olyvar Frey</entity> as a squire . The <entity id=1862>Lannister</entity> armies prepare for battle . <entity id=1863>Tywin</entity> tells his son Tyrion that he means to use the hill tribe forces to give them an edge against the <entity id=1864>Stark</entity> army , essentially to be used as cannon fodder . He orders Tyrion to lead them from the front of the vanguard . <entity id=1865>Tyrion</entity> angrily accuses his father of trying to kill him . He storms back to his tent to find that <entity id=1866>Bronn</entity> has found him , as per instruction , a whore named <entity id=1867>Shae</entity> . <entity id=1868>Tyrion</entity> takes an immediate liking to her . When told they go into battle in the vanguard in the morning , <entity id=1869>Bronn</entity> goes off to find one for himself . <entity id=1870>Tyrion</entity> , <entity id=1871>Bronn</entity> , and <entity id=1872>Shae</entity> play a drinking game the night before the battle . <entity id=1873>Tyrion</entity> makes observations and if he is correct the person has to drink . He guesses correctly that <entity id=1874>Bronn</entity> has been beyond the <entity id=1875>Wall</entity> and killed someone before he was twelve years old ( though it was a woman , not a man , and he killed her in self-defense , because she was coming at him with an axe ) . <entity id=1876>Tyrion</entity> guesses that <entity id=1877>Shae</entity> 's mother was a whore , her father deserted them , and she is low born - however he is wrong on each guess . <entity id=1878>Tyrion</entity> can not read <entity id=1879>Shae</entity> 's personality , but this only makes her more intriguing to him . When <entity id=1880>Shae</entity> starts to question <entity id=1881>Tyrion</entity> , <entity id=1882>Bronn</entity> reveals that he heard <entity id=1881>Tyrion</entity> was once married . Reluctantly , <entity id=1883>Tyrion</entity> explains that when he was very young , he and <entity id=1884>Jaime</entity> were out riding near <entity id=1885>Casterly Rock</entity> and found a young common girl in distress from bandits . While <entity id=1886>Jaime</entity> chased the bandits off , <entity id=1887>Tyrion</entity> comforted the girl , whose name was <entity id=1888>Tysha</entity> . They ended up getting drunk at a local inn , and she became so enamored of him that <entity id=1889>Tyrion</entity> felt like he was n't an ugly dwarf . Later that night she had sex with <entity id=1890>Tyrion</entity> , the first time he was ever with a woman . <entity id=1891>Tyrion</entity> fell madly in love , and bribed a drunken septon to marry them in secret . However , two weeks later his father <entity id=1892>Tywin</entity> found out , and was utterly furious that his son had married a commoner . <entity id=1893>Tywin</entity> forced <entity id=1894>Jaime</entity> to reveal the truth : the girl was a prostitute and <entity id=1894>Jaime</entity> set the situation up to do something nice for his little brother . <entity id=1895>Tywin</entity> then instructed his guards to have sex with her , with her being paid a silver coin for each man , while <entity id=1896>Tyrion</entity> was forced to watch . <entity id=1897>Shae</entity> points out that Tyrion was foolish to believe a woman would sleep with him just hours after almost being raped . As she gets romantic with <entity id=1898>Tyrion</entity> , <entity id=1899>Bronn</entity> leaves the tent . <entity id=1900>Tyrion Lannister</entity> leads the hill tribes into battle . The next morning the <entity id=1901>Lannister</entity> army finds that the Starks have stolen a march on them ; they are about to be attacked and have to hastily prepare for battle . <entity id=1902>Tyrion</entity> gives a rousing speech to his hill tribesmen , but as they charge for the front he is first nearly trampled and then knocked out by an accidental blow to the head from someone 's club . When he regains consciousness on the back of a wagon , <entity id=1903>Bronn</entity> tells him that the <entity id=1904>Lannisters</entity> won the battle , but it was a feint . As a diversion , <entity id=1905>Robb</entity> sent a small portion of his army to confront and delay <entity id=1906>Tywin</entity> 's forces , while the main army marched on <entity id=1907>Riverrun</entity> to attack <entity id=1908>Jaime</entity> 's army . <entity id=1909>Jaime</entity> is captured by <entity id=1910>Robb</entity> 's army . <entity id=1911>Robb Robb</entity> after his victory . <entity id=1912>Catelyn</entity> and <entity id=1913>Ser Rodrik Cassel</entity> are waiting in woodlands as they hear sounds of battle . Suddenly Robb returns from his victory with his guards and a prisoner , <entity id=1914>Jaime</entity> himself . The <entity id=1915>Battle</entity> of the <entity id=1916>Whispering Wood</entity> has lifted the siege of <entity id=1917>Riverrun</entity> , and <entity id=1918>Jaime</entity> 's army has been destroyed . Jaime suggests they end the war now with a bout of single combat between himself and <entity id=1919>Robb</entity> , but <entity id=1919>Robb</entity> refuses and has him imprisoned . <entity id=1920>Robb</entity> laments that his diversion sent 2,000 men to their deaths . He gives a speech to his army and tells them that they have won a great victory , but the war is far from over . At the <entity id=1921>Wall</entity> . <entity id=1922>Jeor Jeor</entity> gives his sword Longclaw to <entity id=1923>Jon Snow</entity> . At <entity id=1924>Castle Black</entity> , <entity id=1925>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entity> gives <entity id=1926>Jon Snow</entity> a <entity id=1927>Valyrian</entity> steel sword , <entity id=1928>Longclaw</entity> , in thanks for saving his life . <entity id=1929>Mormont</entity> also reinstates <entity id=1930>Jon</entity> to his former position and tells him he has dispatched <entity id=1931>Ser Alliser Thorne</entity> to <entity id=1932>King</entity> 's Landing to lay the hand of the wight they found at the feet of the King and ask for aid . <entity id=1933>Maester Maester</entity> reveals his true identity . <entity id=1934>Mormont</entity> explains to Jon that <entity id=1935>Longclaw</entity> was meant for his own son , <entity id=1936>Ser Jorah Mormont</entity> , but he disgraced himself and fled in exile to <entity id=1937>Essos</entity> . <entity id=1938>Jon</entity> goes to the dining hall and the other recruits make a fuss over the sword , but <entity id=1939>Samwell Tarly</entity> seems distant from the revelry . <entity id=1940>Sam</entity> takes <entity id=1941>Jon</entity> aside and informs him about <entity id=1942>Robb</entity> leading an army south to war . <entity id=1943>Jon</entity> ponders that he should be with him , but <entity id=1944>Maester Aemon</entity> tells him their duty to the <entity id=1945>Night's Watch</entity> comes first . To <entity id=1946>Jon</entity> 's surprise , <entity id=1947>Aemon</entity> reveals that his full name is <entity id=1948>Aemon Targaryen</entity> , the son of a king , brother to another , the uncle of the <entity id=1949>Mad King</entity> . <entity id=1950>Aemon</entity> had to stand aside and do nothing while his entire family was butchered or exiled during <entity id=1951>Robert</entity> 's Rebellion . It is not an easy life they have chosen . <entity id=1952>Aemon</entity> remarks that he can not make <entity id=1953>Jon</entity> stay or go ; like the <entity id=1954>Maester</entity> , <entity id=1953>Jon</entity> must make the choice himself , and live with the consequences of it for the rest of his life . Across the <entity id=1955>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity id=1956>Drogo</entity> after his fall . <entity id=1957>Far</entity> to the east , <entity id=1958>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> is concerned that the wound her husband <entity id=1959>Khal Drogo</entity> took fighting <entity id=1960>Mago</entity> has festered and become infected . He falls from his horse , a grave sign of weakness amongst the <entity id=1961>Dothraki</entity> . <entity id=1962>Daenerys</entity> tells the khalasar that they are stopping and requests for <entity id=1963>Qotho</entity> to get <entity id=1964>Mirri Maz Duur</entity> to help <entity id=1965>Drogo</entity> . <entity id=1966>Qotho</entity> is unhappy with entrusting <entity id=1967>Drogo</entity> 's care to the woman , whom he calls a maegi or witch , but relents . At <entity id=1968>Daenerys</entity> ' request , <entity id=1969>Ser Jorah</entity> armors himself . <entity id=1970>Jorah</entity> also advises her to leave now , because <entity id=1971>Drogo</entity> is certain to die and when he dies , his lieutenants will fight amongst themselves to be his successor ; whoever wins will kill <entity id=1972>Daenerys</entity> 's son , rather than risk the boy growing up to be a rival , but <entity id=1972>Daenerys</entity> refuses to abandon her husband . <entity id=1973>Mirri Mirri</entity> promises to save <entity id=1974>Drogo</entity> 's life , but she needs to sacrifice a life in exchange . She takes <entity id=1975>Drogo</entity> 's horse into his tent and starts the ceremony , slitting the animal 's throat over <entity id=1975>Drogo</entity> 's comatose form . <entity id=1976>Jorah Jorah</entity> helps <entity id=1977>Daenerys</entity> . Some of <entity id=1978>Drogo</entity> 's warriors become enraged at what they see as <entity id=1979>Daenerys</entity> ' attempts to interfere with the natural way of things and <entity id=1980>Qotho</entity> tries to attack her , but <entity id=1981>Ser Jorah</entity> kills him . <entity id=1982>Daenerys</entity> starts to go into labor , but none of the <entity id=1983>Dothraki</entity> midwives will help her , thinking she is cursed . With no choice , <entity id=1984>Jorah</entity> takes <entity id=1985>Daenerys</entity> into the tent as the ceremony continues . In <entity id=1986>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity id=1987>Varys</entity> visits <entity id=1988>Eddard Stark</entity> in the dungeons under the <entity id=1989>Red Keep</entity> . <entity id=1990>Varys</entity> tells <entity id=1991>Eddard</entity> that <entity id=1992>Sansa</entity> begged for his life before the whole court and that <entity id=1993>Robb</entity> is leading an army from the <entity id=1994>North</entity> . In addition , the <entity id=1995>Queen</entity> is more concerned over the intentions of King <entity id=1996>Robert</entity> 's brother , <entity id=1997>Stannis</entity> , a proven battle commander known to be without mercy . For the sake of <entity id=1998>Sansa</entity> 's life , <entity id=1999>Varys</entity> urges <entity id=2000>Eddard</entity> to confess to treason . In return , <entity id=2001>Cersei</entity> will let him take the black and join his younger brother <entity id=2002>Benjen</entity> and bastard son <entity id=2003>Jon Snow</entity> on the <entity id=2004>Wall</entity> . <entity id=2005>Eddard</entity> is angered by the suggestion that he would trade in his honesty and honor for his life , though he appears to have second thoughts when <entity id=2006>Varys</entity> insinuates that <entity id=2007>Sansa</entity> would pay the price for his defiance . <entity id=2008>Arya Arya</entity> is living rough on the streets of the city . She catches a pigeon and tries to trade it for a slice of bread , to no avail . She sees crowds moving through the streets and is told that the <entity id=2009>Hand</entity> of the King is being brought before the <entity id=2010>Great Sept</entity> of <entity id=2011>Baelor</entity> , the center of religious worship in the city . Stunned that she will see her father she drops the pigeon and joins the crowd . <entity id=2012>Unable</entity> to see , she climbs unto the pedestal of a statue of <entity id=2013>Baelor</entity> ( a previous Targaryen king , Baelor the <entity id=2014>Blessed</entity> , for whom the <entity id=2015>Sept</entity> is named ) . She sees her father being brought in chains to the steps of the temple . He sees <entity id=2016>Arya</entity> on the statue , and as he is dragged through the crowd he passes <entity id=2017>Yoren</entity> of the <entity id=2018>Night's Watch</entity> ( who had met <entity id=2016>Arya</entity> ) . <entity id=2019>Lord Lord</entity> looks at the statue and says , `` <entity id=2020>Baelor</entity> , '' puzzling the crowd . <entity id=2021>Yoren</entity> understands , however , and moves toward the statue where <entity id=2022>Arya</entity> is watching . <entity id=2023>Eddard</entity> is given a chance to confess his `` crimes . '' He weighs his choices as he sees both Arya and <entity id=2024>Sansa</entity> present , and chooses to save them by making a false confession . He says that <entity id=2025>Joffrey</entity> is the true King on the <entity id=2026>Iron Throne</entity> , pleasing him . <entity id=2027>Grand Grand</entity> extols the virtues of mercy and <entity id=2028>Joffrey</entity> agrees that he could be merciful and send <entity id=2029>Eddard</entity> to the <entity id=2030>Night's Watch</entity> as his mother has suggested and as <entity id=2031>Sansa</entity> has begged . He instead acknowledges that as women they are `` soft '' and treason must never go unpunished . He commands <entity id=2032>Ser Ilyn Payne</entity> to bring him the traitor 's head . <entity id=2033>Ser Ser</entity> executes <entity id=2034>Eddard Stark</entity> . The crowd goes into an uproar . <entity id=2035>Arya</entity> tries to make her way through the crowd drawing her sword to save her father , but <entity id=2036>Yoren</entity> grabs and stops her , shielding her from seeing her father 's death . <entity id=2037>Sansa</entity> screams and is restrained by guards . A visibly horrified <entity id=2038>Cersei</entity> frantically tries to persuade her son to reconsider , as does <entity id=2039>Varys</entity> , but there is no time . Forced to kneel , <entity id=2040>Eddard</entity> looks at the statue and sees that <entity id=2041>Arya</entity> has been rescued by <entity id=2042>Yoren</entity> , and is relieved that she is safe . <entity id=2043>Ser Ser</entity> draws <entity id=2044>Eddard</entity> 's own sword , Ice , and cuts his head off with a single blow . A flock of pigeons takes flight immediately afterwards , the sight being all Arya needs to know her father is dead .
