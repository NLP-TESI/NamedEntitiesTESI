<entity id=628>Tyrion Lannister</entity> stops at <entity id=629>Winterfell</entity> on his way back to <entity id=630>King</entity> 's Landing and gets a frosty reception from <entity id=631>Robb Stark</entity> , despite an act of kindness for <entity id=632>Bran</entity> . <entity id=633>Samwell Samwell</entity> joins the <entity id=634>Night's Watch</entity> , and <entity id=635>Jon</entity> becomes his friend and protector . <entity id=636>Daenerys</entity> arrives at <entity id=637>Vaes Dothrak</entity> and finally stands up to <entity id=638>Viserys</entity> . <entity id=639>Eddard Eddard</entity> continues to investigate the death of <entity id=640>Jon Arryn</entity> . King <entity id=641>Robert Baratheon</entity> hosts a grand tourney for <entity id=642>Eddard</entity> 's investiture as <entity id=643>Hand</entity> of the King , to <entity id=644>Ned</entity> 's discomfort . <entity id=645>Catelyn</entity> and <entity id=646>Ser Rodrik Cassel</entity> stop at the <entity id=647>Crossroads Inn</entity> . In the <entity id=648>North</entity> . <entity id=649>Tyrion</entity> speaks with <entity id=650>Bran</entity> . In <entity id=651>Winterfell</entity> , <entity id=652>Bran Stark</entity> has a nightmare in which he sees a three-eyed raven , sitting on one of the stone direwolves outside the doorway to the Stark crypts . He wakes up to find his direwolf Summer by his side . Theon Greyjoy summons <entity id=653>Hodor</entity> , the castle 's dim-witted stableboy , who can only say the word `` Hodor '' , to help carry <entity id=654>Bran</entity> down to the great hall , where <entity id=655>Robb Stark</entity> is hosting a meeting with <entity id=656>Tyrion Lannister</entity> and <entity id=657>Yoren</entity> , both traveling down from the <entity id=658>Wall</entity> to <entity id=659>King</entity> 's Landing together . <entity id=660>Robb</entity> very pointedly offers hospitality to any man of the <entity id=661>Watch</entity> , silently letting Tyrion know he is not invited to stay at <entity id=662>Winterfell</entity> . When <entity id=663>Bran</entity> arrives , <entity id=664>Tyrion</entity> sympathizes with <entity id=663>Bran</entity> for being a cripple , which annoys <entity id=663>Bran</entity> , as does asking him if he likes to ride , but <entity id=664>Tyrion</entity> simply says it is the truth , no less so for being a hard truth . He gives the Starks the design of a saddle which will allow <entity id=665>Bran</entity> to ride even in his current state . He does it to repay <entity id=666>Bran</entity> 's half-brother 's friendship and because he has a weakness for , `` <entity id=667>Cripples</entity> , bastards and broken things . '' Due to this kindness , <entity id=668>Robb</entity> says he can stay , but <entity id=669>Tyrion</entity> says he would prefer the brothel in town . While preparing to leave the castle , <entity id=670>Theon</entity> comes to <entity id=671>Tyrion</entity> and rather condescendingly sends him off , recommending the prostitute <entity id=672>Ros</entity> at the brothel . <entity id=673>Tyrion</entity> asks Theon why <entity id=674>Lady Catelyn</entity> was not present to receive him and concludes that <entity id=675>Catelyn</entity> is not in <entity id=676>Winterfell</entity> . He also taunts Theon about how the son of the ferocious <entity id=677>Balon Greyjoy</entity> has been reduced to playing lackey in <entity id=678>Winterfell</entity> to his captors , which infuriates Theon and gives him a coin , assuming that he has not already had sex with <entity id=679>Ros</entity> . At the <entity id=680>Wall</entity> . <entity id=681>Samwell Samwell</entity> joins the new recruits at <entity id=682>Castle Black</entity> . At <entity id=683>Castle Black</entity> , a new recruit for the <entity id=684>Night's Watch</entity> has arrived : <entity id=685>Samwell Tarly</entity> , the son of the famous <entity id=686>Lord Randyll Tarly</entity> . <entity id=687>Samwell</entity> is fat , soft and pampered , and in his first practice fight does dismally . <entity id=688>Ser Ser</entity> has no time for his weakness . He directs the other recruits to attack 'Ser Piggy ' , but <entity id=689>Jon Snow</entity> finds this cruel and unfair , and takes pity on <entity id=690>Sam</entity> and fends off the attackers . <entity id=691>Thorne</entity> tries to turn it into a game , ordering three trainees take on <entity id=692>Sam</entity> 's protector ( taunting <entity id=693>Jon</entity> that he has found a new <entity id=694>Lady</entity> love ) , but <entity id=693>Jon</entity> nevertheless fends them all off . <entity id=695>Samwell</entity> is naive and self-deprecating , claiming to be a coward and craven , to <entity id=696>Jon</entity> 's astonishment . No one admits to being a coward , and <entity id=697>Grenn</entity> says that they should n't even be seen talking to him . <entity id=698>Sam</entity> joins <entity id=699>Jon</entity> on the <entity id=700>Wall</entity> for sentry duty , even though he says his eyesight is weak , he is afraid of heights , and ca n't take the cold . <entity id=701>Jon</entity> asks why he joined the <entity id=702>Night's Watch</entity> as he is afraid of everything . <entity id=703>Sam</entity> tells him that on his eighteenth nameday his father offered him a choice . <entity id=704>Sam</entity> was a man and his heir , but he was not skilled at combat , he was unworthy of his name and birthright . <entity id=705>Samwall</entity> 's father forced him to join the <entity id=706>Night's Watch</entity> , and told him that if he refused , he would arrange a `` hunting trip '' with his son in the woods , and implied that <entity id=707>Sam</entity> would be killed in a way that looked accidental . <entity id=708>Jon</entity> is shocked that a true born son of high birth should be treated worse than he himself had been as a bastard . <entity id=709>Sam</entity> knows that the next day he will be made to fight again and expects it to be bad . <entity id=710>Grenn</entity> yields to <entity id=711>Samwell</entity> . At the <entity id=712>Wall</entity> , <entity id=713>Jon</entity> orders the recruits to go easy on <entity id=714>Sam</entity> , but <entity id=715>Rast</entity> refuses , saying that if <entity id=716>Ser Alliser</entity> orders him to fight 'Lady <entity id=717>Piggy</entity> ' , he will slice himself off a side of bacon . In response to <entity id=718>Rast</entity> 's comments , <entity id=719>Jon</entity> goes to his bed that night and uses his direwolf <entity id=720>Ghost</entity> to intimidate <entity id=718>Rast</entity> into playing along . The next day , no one will fight <entity id=721>Sam</entity> . After <entity id=722>Grenn</entity> takes a very weak blow from <entity id=723>Sam</entity> and yields , <entity id=724>Ser Alliser</entity> scolds <entity id=725>Jon</entity> for his rebellious actions . Later , when <entity id=726>Jon</entity> and <entity id=727>Sam</entity> are cleaning the dining hall , they talk about how neither of them have been with a woman . <entity id=728>Sam</entity> tells <entity id=729>Jon</entity> that he has not had success with girls , while <entity id=729>Jon</entity> reveals he 'd rather not risk siring a child that will have the life of a bastard like himself . A furious <entity id=730>Alliser Thorne</entity> comes in and tells <entity id=731>Jon</entity> that this charity wo n't help <entity id=732>Sam</entity> harden up to survive the winter that is coming . He tells them the truly horrific experience he went through trapped by a blizzard north of the Wall that ended in cannibalism . Across the <entity id=733>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity id=734>Khal Khal</entity> 's khalasar arrives at <entity id=735>Vaes Dothrak</entity> , the <entity id=736>Dothraki</entity> city . There are no city walls , but there is a large gateway arch made of two statues of rearing horses . <entity id=737>Viserys</entity> is annoyed that <entity id=738>Drogo</entity> has been taking 'his ' army in the wrong direction . Later , he bathes with <entity id=739>Doreah</entity> and tells her about how he was raised with stories about the <entity id=740>Targaryen</entity> dragons and his own destiny . He recites the names of several dragons , and tells her about the skulls of dragons that once decorated the throne room at <entity id=741>King</entity> 's Landing , but she starts to annoy him with talk of dragons , reminding him that they are dead . He tells her to finish pleasuring him in silence . <entity id=742>Viserys</entity> is enraged when <entity id=743>Daenerys</entity> sends <entity id=744>Doreah</entity> with an invite for him to dine with her , as he interprets this as his sister commanding him to come . He drags <entity id=745>Doreah</entity> into <entity id=746>Daenerys</entity> ' tent , and insults her dinner and the gifts of clothes she tries to give him . He is still dressed in his now ragged clothes from <entity id=747>Pentos</entity> , having refused to dress like a <entity id=748>Dothraki</entity> , whom he regards as savage pordh . He sneers that next she will try to braid his hair like a Dothraki . <entity id=749>Daenerys</entity> retorts that he has no right to braid his hair until he is victorious in battle , which further infuriates him . In his anger , <entity id=750>Viserys</entity> tackles her to the ground and tries to strike her , calling her nothing but a `` horselord 's slut '' , and warning her that she 's `` awoken the <entity id=751>Dragon</entity> '' , but this time she fights back , hitting him in the face with a metal and leather belt . She tells a thunderstruck Viserys that she is the <entity id=752>Khal</entity> 's wife , and is carrying his child ( and by implication , <entity id=753>Viserys</entity> is nothing to the <entity id=754>Dothraki</entity> ) , and warns that if he raises a hand against her again , he will lose his hands . Later , <entity id=755>Daenerys</entity> confides in <entity id=756>Mormont</entity> her realization that <entity id=757>Viserys</entity> will never become King of <entity id=758>Westeros</entity> . He is so weak and ineffectual that he could n't command an army even if <entity id=759>Drogo</entity> gave him one , to which <entity id=760>Jorah</entity> agrees . In <entity id=761>King</entity> 's Landing . In the <entity id=762>Red Keep</entity> , <entity id=763>Sansa Stark</entity> visits the <entity id=764>Great Hall</entity> , where the <entity id=765>Iron Throne</entity> sits . She and <entity id=766>Septa Mordane</entity> discuss the expectation that <entity id=767>Sansa</entity> will have to provide <entity id=768>Joffrey</entity> with an heir . <entity id=769>Sansa</entity> thinks the realm will hate her if she only has daughters , along with her belief <entity id=770>Joffrey</entity> is still angry over the incident by the river and her anger at her father over <entity id=771>Lady</entity> 's death . The small council meets . During a meeting of the small council , <entity id=772>Lord Eddard</entity> learns that the forthcoming tournament to celebrate his appointment is seeing the city swell with visitors , and has already resulted in a tavern riot , a brothel fire , three stabbings and a drunken horse race . He tells Littlefinger that money will have to be found to strengthen the city guards , as well as giving twenty of his own men to <entity id=773>Janos Slynt</entity> 's command , until the tournament is over . After the meeting <entity id=774>Eddard</entity> talks to <entity id=775>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> about <entity id=776>Jon Arryn</entity> 's last few weeks . <entity id=777>Pycelle</entity> said he did all he could to save <entity id=778>Jon Arryn</entity> , but the illness was sudden and severe . He recalls that shortly before his sudden illness , <entity id=779>Arryn</entity> had borrowed a truly boring book about the lineages of the <entity id=780>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , and his last words were , `` The seed is strong . `` . Taking the book with him , <entity id=781>Eddard</entity> comes across <entity id=782>Arya</entity> in the hall standing on one leg as part of her training with <entity id=783>Syrio</entity> . <entity id=784>Arya</entity> asks whether <entity id=785>Bran</entity> would be able to live in <entity id=786>King</entity> 's Landing with them now that he 's awoken , but <entity id=787>Eddard</entity> states that he would have to regain his strength first . <entity id=788>Arya</entity> then comments that <entity id=789>Bran</entity> had always wanted to be a knight in the King 's <entity id=790>Guard</entity> , but will no longer be able to due to his paralysis . Eddard confirms this to be the case , but states that <entity id=791>Bran</entity> will be able to do many other things such as become lord of a holdfast , sit on the King 's council , or raise castles . When <entity id=792>Arya</entity> asks if she would be able to become any of those , <entity id=793>Eddard</entity> instead tells her that she will marry a highborn lord and have lords and princes for sons . However , <entity id=794>Arya</entity> is not pleased with this response , telling her father , `` that 's not me . '' She goes back to balancing on one leg as <entity id=795>Eddard</entity> looks on . <entity id=796>Petyr</entity> talks with <entity id=797>Eddard</entity> . <entity id=798>Littlefinger</entity> meets with <entity id=799>Eddard</entity> and suggests that he keep his investigation into <entity id=800>Jon Arryn</entity> 's death lower in profile . He also gives <entity id=801>Eddard</entity> some interesting intelligence : <entity id=802>Jon Arryn</entity> 's former squire has been knighted and will fight in the forthcoming <entity id=803>Hand</entity> 's tourney . He also advises him to investigate an armorer located in the city . <entity id=804>Eddard</entity> decides that <entity id=805>Littlefinger</entity> may be more trustworthy than he first thought , but <entity id=805>Littlefinger</entity> discourages him from thinking that way . <entity id=806>Eddard</entity> sends <entity id=807>Jory Cassel</entity> to question <entity id=808>Jon Arryn</entity> 's former squire , <entity id=809>Ser Hugh</entity> of the <entity id=810>Vale</entity> . However , deducing that <entity id=811>Jory</entity> was not a knight , <entity id=812>Ser Hugh</entity> simply rebuffs him and refuses to speak with him due to his much lower rank . <entity id=813>Eddard</entity> 's investigation leads him to a smithy in the city , where he meets master smith <entity id=814>Tobho Mott</entity> and his apprentice <entity id=815>Gendry</entity> , whose work <entity id=816>Jon Arryn</entity> was also apparently interested in . <entity id=817>Eddard</entity> realizes that <entity id=818>Gendry</entity> is one of King <entity id=819>Robert</entity> 's bastard sons , but ca n't work out why <entity id=820>Jon Arryn</entity> would be interested in this : <entity id=819>Robert</entity> has many bastard children and shows little interest in any of them . Later , <entity id=821>Eddard</entity> sends <entity id=822>Jory</entity> with a message for King <entity id=823>Robert</entity> , but upon arriving at his quarters , the sounds of many women can he heard coming from <entity id=823>Robert</entity> 's chamber . <entity id=824>Ser Ser</entity> happens to be on duty and is angry that the king keeps him guarding his chamber while he cavorts with other women inside , flaunting his dishonorable treatment of <entity id=825>Jaime</entity> 's sister in his face . He and <entity id=826>Jory</entity> reminisce about the <entity id=827>Greyjoy Rebellion</entity> , in which they both fought for King <entity id=828>Robert</entity> 's forces to put down an attempt by <entity id=829>Balon Greyjoy</entity> ( Theon 's father ) to secede the <entity id=830>Iron Islands</entity> from the rest of the realm . <entity id=831>Jory</entity> tries to leave <entity id=832>Eddard</entity> 's message with <entity id=833>Jaime</entity> , but is rebuffed , as <entity id=833>Jaime</entity> angrily states that he does not serve <entity id=834>Lord Stark</entity> . <entity id=835>Littlefinger</entity> , <entity id=836>Arya</entity> , <entity id=837>Sansa</entity> and <entity id=838>Septa Mordane</entity> at the tournament . The tournament begins and <entity id=839>Sansa</entity> watches from the stands . <entity id=840>Ser Ser</entity> , the elder brother of <entity id=841>Sandor Clegane</entity> , the <entity id=842>Hound</entity> , takes the field . His first joust is with <entity id=843>Ser Hugh</entity> . However , the friendly joust turns nasty and <entity id=844>Gregor kills Ser Hugh</entity> `` by accident '' , with a splinter of the lance impaling his neck . <entity id=845>Littlefinger</entity> sits next to <entity id=846>Sansa</entity> , and remarks that she and <entity id=847>Joffrey</entity> have had a lover 's quarrel ( as <entity id=847>Joffrey</entity> is still giving her the cold shoulder ) . <entity id=848>Baelish</entity> then tells <entity id=849>Sansa</entity> that <entity id=850>Gregor</entity> , the `` Mountain That Rides '' , has a dark reputation : he pushed his little brother <entity id=851>Sandor</entity> 's face into a fire for taking and playing with a toy of his when they were young , burning him severely . <entity id=852>Littlefinger</entity> recommends that <entity id=853>Sansa</entity> not spread that story around . <entity id=854>Cersei</entity> visits <entity id=855>Eddard</entity> at his chambers , remarking at how the <entity id=856>Hand</entity> is not at his own tournament . Though <entity id=857>Cersei</entity> attempts to start the conversation in an attempt to put the incident on the <entity id=858>Kingsroad</entity> behind them , <entity id=859>Eddard</entity> correctly deduces that she has an ulterior motive for her visit . <entity id=860>Cersei</entity> then wonders aloud to Eddard what his true purpose is for being at <entity id=861>King</entity> 's Landing , as she knows how little Starks enjoy being in the capital . When <entity id=862>Eddard</entity> tells her he is to faithfully serve their King , <entity id=863>Cersei</entity> remarks that as his brother <entity id=864>Brandon</entity> was born to lead , <entity id=862>Eddard</entity> was born to follow . In the <entity id=865>Riverlands</entity> . At the <entity id=866>Crossroads Inn</entity> , <entity id=867>Catelyn</entity> and <entity id=868>Ser Rodrik Cassel</entity> , on their way home to <entity id=869>Winterfell</entity> , are enjoying the hospitality of the innkeeper and , more reluctantly , the attempts by the troubadour Marillion to ingratiate himself with them . ( He is doing a poor job : when he asks if they would like a song , he is refused . ) They are surprised when <entity id=870>Tyrion Lannister</entity> and <entity id=871>Yoren</entity> arrive . When told there are n't any rooms , <entity id=872>Tyrion</entity> holds up a gold coin and asks if someone has a room for him . <entity id=873>Quickly Tyrion</entity> gains the favor of a sellsword , <entity id=874>Bronn</entity> , who agrees to give his room to <entity id=875>Tyrion</entity> . <entity id=876>Marillion</entity> draws the attention of <entity id=877>Tyrion</entity> to <entity id=878>Catelyn</entity> 's table , by offering to serenade him while he eats , singing of his father 's military victories . <entity id=879>Tyrion</entity> says nothing would more likely ruin his appetite , but as he is turning away , he recognizes <entity id=880>Catelyn</entity> and is surprised at this meeting by chance . In return <entity id=881>Catelyn</entity> tells the stunned inn that <entity id=882>Tyrion</entity> tried to murder her son <entity id=883>Bran</entity> twice and that she asks their help in bringing him to the king 's justice . The inn is located in the <entity id=884>Riverlands</entity> , in the territory controlled by her father , so the knights present owe him their fealty . <entity id=885>Tyrion</entity> finds himself surrounded by half a dozen men with swords , and in <entity id=886>Catelyn</entity> 's custody .
