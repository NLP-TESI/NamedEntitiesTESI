<entity class="NE" id=624>Tyrion Lannister</entity> stops at <entity class="NE" id=625>Winterfell</entity> on his way back to <entity class="NE" id=626>King</entity> 's Landing and gets a frosty reception from <entity class="NE" id=627>Robb Stark</entity> , despite an act of kindness for <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=629>Samwell Samwell</entity> joins the <entity class="NE" id=630>Night's Watch</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> becomes his friend and protector . <entity class="NE" id=632>Daenerys</entity> arrives at <entity class="NE" id=633>Vaes Dothrak</entity> and finally stands up to <entity class="NE" id=634>Viserys</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=635>Eddard Eddard</entity> continues to investigate the death of <entity class="NE" id=636>Jon Arryn</entity> . King <entity class="NE" id=637>Robert Baratheon</entity> hosts a grand tourney for <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> 's investiture as <entity class="NE" id=639>Hand</entity> of the King , to <entity class="NE" id=640>Ned</entity> 's discomfort . <entity class="NE" id=641>Catelyn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=642>Ser Rodrik Cassel</entity> stop at the <entity class="NE" id=643>Crossroads Inn</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=644>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> speaks with <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=625>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=648>Bran Stark</entity> has a nightmare in which he sees a three-eyed raven , sitting on one of the stone direwolves outside the doorway to the Stark crypts . He wakes up to find his direwolf Summer by his side . Theon Greyjoy summons <entity class="NE" id=649>Hodor</entity> , the castle 's dim-witted stableboy , who can only say the word `` Hodor '' , to help carry <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> down to the great hall , where <entity class="NE" id=627>Robb Stark</entity> is hosting a meeting with <entity class="NE" id=624>Tyrion Lannister</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=653>Yoren</entity> , both traveling down from the <entity class="NE" id=654>Wall</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=626>King</entity> 's Landing together . <entity class="NE" id=656>Robb</entity> very pointedly offers hospitality to any man of the <entity class="NE" id=657>Watch</entity> , silently letting Tyrion know he is not invited to stay at <entity class="NE" id=625>Winterfell</entity> . When <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> arrives , <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> sympathizes with <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> for being a cripple , which annoys <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> , as does asking him if he likes to ride , but <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> simply says it is the truth , no less so for being a hard truth . He gives the Starks the design of a saddle which will allow <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> to ride even in his current state . He does it to repay <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> 's half-brother 's friendship and because he has a weakness for , `` <entity class="NE" id=663>Cripples</entity> , bastards and broken things . '' Due to this kindness , <entity class="NE" id=656>Robb</entity> says he can stay , but <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> says he would prefer the brothel in town . While preparing to leave the castle , <entity class="NE" id=666>Theon</entity> comes to <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> and rather condescendingly sends him off , recommending the prostitute <entity class="NE" id=668>Ros</entity> at the brothel . <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> asks Theon why <entity class="NE" id=670>Lady Catelyn</entity> was not present to receive him and concludes that <entity class="NE" id=641>Catelyn</entity> is not in <entity class="NE" id=625>Winterfell</entity> . He also taunts Theon about how the son of the ferocious <entity class="NE" id=673>Balon Greyjoy</entity> has been reduced to playing lackey in <entity class="NE" id=625>Winterfell</entity> to his captors , which infuriates Theon and gives him a coin , assuming that he has not already had sex with <entity class="NE" id=668>Ros</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=654>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=629>Samwell Samwell</entity> joins the new recruits at <entity class="NE" id=678>Castle Black</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=678>Castle Black</entity> , a new recruit for the <entity class="NE" id=630>Night's Watch</entity> has arrived : <entity class="NE" id=681>Samwell Tarly</entity> , the son of the famous <entity class="NE" id=682>Lord Randyll Tarly</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=683>Samwell</entity> is fat , soft and pampered , and in his first practice fight does dismally . Ser Ser has no time for his weakness . He directs the other recruits to attack 'Ser Piggy ' , but <entity class="NE" id=684>Jon Snow</entity> finds this cruel and unfair , and takes pity on <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> and fends off the attackers . <entity class="NE" id=686>Thorne</entity> tries to turn it into a game , ordering three trainees take on <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> 's protector ( taunting <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> that he has found a new <entity class="NE" id=689>Lady</entity> love ) , but <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> nevertheless fends them all off . <entity class="NE" id=683>Samwell</entity> is naive and self-deprecating , claiming to be a coward and craven , to <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> 's astonishment . No one admits to being a coward , and <entity class="NE" id=692>Grenn</entity> says that they should n't even be seen talking to him . <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> joins <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> on the <entity class="NE" id=654>Wall</entity> for sentry duty , even though he says his eyesight is weak , he is afraid of heights , and ca n't take the cold . <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> asks why he joined the <entity class="NE" id=630>Night's Watch</entity> as he is afraid of everything . <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> tells him that on his eighteenth nameday his father offered him a choice . <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> was a man and his heir , but he was not skilled at combat , he was unworthy of his name and birthright . <entity class="NE" id=700>Samwall</entity> 's father forced him to join the <entity class="NE" id=630>Night's Watch</entity> , and told him that if he refused , he would arrange a `` hunting trip '' with his son in the woods , and implied that <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> would be killed in a way that looked accidental . <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> is shocked that a true born son of high birth should be treated worse than he himself had been as a bastard . <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> knows that the next day he will be made to fight again and expects it to be bad . <entity class="NE" id=692>Grenn</entity> yields to <entity class="NE" id=683>Samwell</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=654>Wall</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> orders the recruits to go easy on <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=710>Rast</entity> refuses , saying that if <entity class="NE" id=711>Ser Alliser</entity> orders him to fight 'Lady <entity class="NE" id=712>Piggy</entity> ' , he will slice himself off a side of bacon . In response to <entity class="NE" id=710>Rast</entity> 's comments , <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> goes to his bed that night and uses his direwolf <entity class="NE" id=715>Ghost</entity> to intimidate <entity class="NE" id=710>Rast</entity> into playing along . The next day , no one will fight <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> . After <entity class="NE" id=692>Grenn</entity> takes a very weak blow from <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> and yields , <entity class="NE" id=711>Ser Alliser</entity> scolds <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> for his rebellious actions . Later , when <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> are cleaning the dining hall , they talk about how neither of them have been with a woman . <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> that he has not had success with girls , while <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> reveals he 'd rather not risk siring a child that will have the life of a bastard like himself . A furious <entity class="NE" id=725>Alliser Thorne</entity> comes in and tells <entity class="NE" id=631>Jon</entity> that this charity wo n't help <entity class="NE" id=685>Sam</entity> harden up to survive the winter that is coming . He tells them the truly horrific experience he went through trapped by a blizzard north of the Wall that ended in cannibalism . Across the <entity class="NE" id=728>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=729>Khal Khal</entity> 's khalasar arrives at <entity class="NE" id=633>Vaes Dothrak</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=731>Dothraki</entity> city . There are no city walls , but there is a large gateway arch made of two statues of rearing horses . <entity class="NE" id=634>Viserys</entity> is annoyed that <entity class="NE" id=733>Drogo</entity> has been taking 'his ' army in the wrong direction . Later , he bathes with <entity class="NE" id=734>Doreah</entity> and tells her about how he was raised with stories about the <entity class="NE" id=735>Targaryen</entity> dragons and his own destiny . He recites the names of several dragons , and tells her about the skulls of dragons that once decorated the throne room at <entity class="NE" id=626>King</entity> 's Landing , but she starts to annoy him with talk of dragons , reminding him that they are dead . He tells her to finish pleasuring him in silence . <entity class="NE" id=634>Viserys</entity> is enraged when <entity class="NE" id=632>Daenerys</entity> sends <entity class="NE" id=734>Doreah</entity> with an invite for him to dine with her , as he interprets this as his sister commanding him to come . He drags <entity class="NE" id=734>Doreah</entity> into <entity class="NE" id=632>Daenerys</entity> ' tent , and insults her dinner and the gifts of clothes she tries to give him . He is still dressed in his now ragged clothes from <entity class="NE" id=742>Pentos</entity> , having refused to dress like a <entity class="NE" id=731>Dothraki</entity> , whom he regards as savage pordh . He sneers that next she will try to braid his hair like a Dothraki . <entity class="NE" id=632>Daenerys</entity> retorts that he has no right to braid his hair until he is victorious in battle , which further infuriates him . In his anger , <entity class="NE" id=634>Viserys</entity> tackles her to the ground and tries to strike her , calling her nothing but a `` horselord 's slut '' , and warning her that she 's `` awoken the <entity class="NE" id=746>Dragon</entity> '' , but this time she fights back , hitting him in the face with a metal and leather belt . She tells a thunderstruck Viserys that she is the <entity class="NE" id=747>Khal</entity> 's wife , and is carrying his child ( and by implication , <entity class="NE" id=634>Viserys</entity> is nothing to the <entity class="NE" id=731>Dothraki</entity> ) , and warns that if he raises a hand against her again , he will lose his hands . Later , <entity class="NE" id=632>Daenerys</entity> confides in <entity class="NE" id=751>Mormont</entity> her realization that <entity class="NE" id=634>Viserys</entity> will never become King of <entity class="NE" id=753>Westeros</entity> . He is so weak and ineffectual that he could n't command an army even if <entity class="NE" id=733>Drogo</entity> gave him one , to which <entity class="NE" id=755>Jorah</entity> agrees . In <entity class="NE" id=626>King</entity> 's Landing . In the <entity class="NE" id=757>Red Keep</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=758>Sansa Stark</entity> visits the <entity class="NE" id=759>Great Hall</entity> , where the <entity class="NE" id=760>Iron Throne</entity> sits . She and <entity class="NE" id=761>Septa Mordane</entity> discuss the expectation that <entity class="NE" id=762>Sansa</entity> will have to provide <entity class="NE" id=763>Joffrey</entity> with an heir . <entity class="NE" id=762>Sansa</entity> thinks the realm will hate her if she only has daughters , along with her belief <entity class="NE" id=763>Joffrey</entity> is still angry over the incident by the river and her anger at her father over <entity class="NE" id=689>Lady</entity> 's death . The small council meets . During a meeting of the small council , <entity class="NE" id=767>Lord Eddard</entity> learns that the forthcoming tournament to celebrate his appointment is seeing the city swell with visitors , and has already resulted in a tavern riot , a brothel fire , three stabbings and a drunken horse race . He tells Littlefinger that money will have to be found to strengthen the city guards , as well as giving twenty of his own men to <entity class="NE" id=768>Janos Slynt</entity> 's command , until the tournament is over . After the meeting <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> talks to <entity class="NE" id=770>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> about <entity class="NE" id=636>Jon Arryn</entity> 's last few weeks . <entity class="NE" id=772>Pycelle</entity> said he did all he could to save <entity class="NE" id=636>Jon Arryn</entity> , but the illness was sudden and severe . He recalls that shortly before his sudden illness , <entity class="NE" id=774>Arryn</entity> had borrowed a truly boring book about the lineages of the <entity class="NE" id=775>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , and his last words were , `` The seed is strong . `` . Taking the book with him , <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> comes across <entity class="NE" id=777>Arya</entity> in the hall standing on one leg as part of her training with <entity class="NE" id=778>Syrio</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=777>Arya</entity> asks whether <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> would be able to live in <entity class="NE" id=626>King</entity> 's Landing with them now that he 's awoken , but <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> states that he would have to regain his strength first . <entity class="NE" id=777>Arya</entity> then comments that <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> had always wanted to be a knight in the King 's <entity class="NE" id=785>Guard</entity> , but will no longer be able to due to his paralysis . Eddard confirms this to be the case , but states that <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> will be able to do many other things such as become lord of a holdfast , sit on the King 's council , or raise castles . When <entity class="NE" id=777>Arya</entity> asks if she would be able to become any of those , <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> instead tells her that she will marry a highborn lord and have lords and princes for sons . However , <entity class="NE" id=777>Arya</entity> is not pleased with this response , telling her father , `` that 's not me . '' She goes back to balancing on one leg as <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> looks on . <entity class="NE" id=791>Petyr</entity> talks with <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=793>Littlefinger</entity> meets with <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> and suggests that he keep his investigation into <entity class="NE" id=636>Jon Arryn</entity> 's death lower in profile . He also gives <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> some interesting intelligence : <entity class="NE" id=636>Jon Arryn</entity> 's former squire has been knighted and will fight in the forthcoming <entity class="NE" id=639>Hand</entity> 's tourney . He also advises him to investigate an armorer located in the city . <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> decides that <entity class="NE" id=793>Littlefinger</entity> may be more trustworthy than he first thought , but <entity class="NE" id=793>Littlefinger</entity> discourages him from thinking that way . <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> sends <entity class="NE" id=802>Jory Cassel</entity> to question <entity class="NE" id=636>Jon Arryn</entity> 's former squire , <entity class="NE" id=804>Ser Hugh</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=805>Vale</entity> . However , deducing that <entity class="NE" id=806>Jory</entity> was not a knight , <entity class="NE" id=804>Ser Hugh</entity> simply rebuffs him and refuses to speak with him due to his much lower rank . <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> 's investigation leads him to a smithy in the city , where he meets master smith <entity class="NE" id=809>Tobho Mott</entity> and his apprentice <entity class="NE" id=810>Gendry</entity> , whose work <entity class="NE" id=636>Jon Arryn</entity> was also apparently interested in . <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> realizes that <entity class="NE" id=810>Gendry</entity> is one of King <entity class="NE" id=814>Robert</entity> 's bastard sons , but ca n't work out why <entity class="NE" id=636>Jon Arryn</entity> would be interested in this : <entity class="NE" id=814>Robert</entity> has many bastard children and shows little interest in any of them . Later , <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> sends <entity class="NE" id=806>Jory</entity> with a message for King <entity class="NE" id=814>Robert</entity> , but upon arriving at his quarters , the sounds of many women can he heard coming from <entity class="NE" id=814>Robert</entity> 's chamber . Ser Ser happens to be on duty and is angry that the king keeps him guarding his chamber while he cavorts with other women inside , flaunting his dishonorable treatment of <entity class="NE" id=819>Jaime</entity> 's sister in his face . He and <entity class="NE" id=806>Jory</entity> reminisce about the <entity class="NE" id=821>Greyjoy Rebellion</entity> , in which they both fought for King <entity class="NE" id=814>Robert</entity> 's forces to put down an attempt by <entity class="NE" id=673>Balon Greyjoy</entity> ( Theon 's father ) to secede the <entity class="NE" id=824>Iron Islands</entity> from the rest of the realm . <entity class="NE" id=806>Jory</entity> tries to leave <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> 's message with <entity class="NE" id=819>Jaime</entity> , but is rebuffed , as <entity class="NE" id=819>Jaime</entity> angrily states that he does not serve <entity class="NE" id=828>Lord Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=793>Littlefinger</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=777>Arya</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=762>Sansa</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=761>Septa Mordane</entity> at the tournament . The tournament begins and <entity class="NE" id=762>Sansa</entity> watches from the stands . Ser Ser , the elder brother of <entity class="NE" id=834>Sandor Clegane</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=835>Hound</entity> , takes the field . His first joust is with <entity class="NE" id=804>Ser Hugh</entity> . However , the friendly joust turns nasty and <entity class="NE" id=837>Gregor kills Ser Hugh</entity> `` by accident '' , with a splinter of the lance impaling his neck . <entity class="NE" id=793>Littlefinger</entity> sits next to <entity class="NE" id=762>Sansa</entity> , and remarks that she and <entity class="NE" id=763>Joffrey</entity> have had a lover 's quarrel ( as <entity class="NE" id=763>Joffrey</entity> is still giving her the cold shoulder ) . <entity class="NE" id=841>Baelish</entity> then tells <entity class="NE" id=762>Sansa</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=843>Gregor</entity> , the `` Mountain That Rides '' , has a dark reputation : he pushed his little brother <entity class="NE" id=844>Sandor</entity> 's face into a fire for taking and playing with a toy of his when they were young , burning him severely . <entity class="NE" id=793>Littlefinger</entity> recommends that <entity class="NE" id=762>Sansa</entity> not spread that story around . <entity class="NE" id=847>Cersei</entity> visits <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> at his chambers , remarking at how the <entity class="NE" id=639>Hand</entity> is not at his own tournament . Though <entity class="NE" id=847>Cersei</entity> attempts to start the conversation in an attempt to put the incident on the <entity class="NE" id=851>Kingsroad</entity> behind them , <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> correctly deduces that she has an ulterior motive for her visit . <entity class="NE" id=847>Cersei</entity> then wonders aloud to Eddard what his true purpose is for being at <entity class="NE" id=626>King</entity> 's Landing , as she knows how little Starks enjoy being in the capital . When <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> tells her he is to faithfully serve their King , <entity class="NE" id=847>Cersei</entity> remarks that as his brother <entity class="NE" id=857>Brandon</entity> was born to lead , <entity class="NE" id=638>Eddard</entity> was born to follow . In the <entity class="NE" id=858>Riverlands</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=643>Crossroads Inn</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=641>Catelyn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=642>Ser Rodrik Cassel</entity> , on their way home to <entity class="NE" id=625>Winterfell</entity> , are enjoying the hospitality of the innkeeper and , more reluctantly , the attempts by the troubadour Marillion to ingratiate himself with them . ( He is doing a poor job : when he asks if they would like a song , he is refused . ) They are surprised when <entity class="NE" id=624>Tyrion Lannister</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=653>Yoren</entity> arrive . When told there are n't any rooms , <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> holds up a gold coin and asks if someone has a room for him . <entity class="NE" id=866>Quickly Tyrion</entity> gains the favor of a sellsword , <entity class="NE" id=867>Bronn</entity> , who agrees to give his room to <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=869>Marillion</entity> draws the attention of <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=641>Catelyn</entity> 's table , by offering to serenade him while he eats , singing of his father 's military victories . <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> says nothing would more likely ruin his appetite , but as he is turning away , he recognizes <entity class="NE" id=641>Catelyn</entity> and is surprised at this meeting by chance . In return <entity class="NE" id=641>Catelyn</entity> tells the stunned inn that <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> tried to murder her son <entity class="NE" id=628>Bran</entity> twice and that she asks their help in bringing him to the king 's justice . The inn is located in the <entity class="NE" id=858>Riverlands</entity> , in the territory controlled by her father , so the knights present owe him their fealty . <entity class="NE" id=645>Tyrion</entity> finds himself surrounded by half a dozen men with swords , and in <entity class="NE" id=641>Catelyn</entity> 's custody .
