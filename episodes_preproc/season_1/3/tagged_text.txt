<entity class="NE" id=436>Jon Jon</entity> attempts to find his footing at <entity class="NE" id=437>Castle Black</entity> amidst hostility and suspicion from his fellow members of the <entity class="NE" id=438>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=439>Eddard Eddard</entity> and his daughters arrive at <entity class="NE" id=440>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=441>Catelyn</entity> renews an old friendship with a member of the court , while <entity class="NE" id=442>Daenerys</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=443>Viserys</entity> journey onwards to the <entity class="NE" id=444>Dothraki</entity> capital of <entity class="NE" id=445>Vaes Dothrak</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=446>King</entity> 's Landing . The <entity class="NE" id=447>Stark</entity> party arrives in <entity class="NE" id=448>King</entity> 's Landing . The royal party reaches <entity class="NE" id=449>King</entity> 's Landing . Almost immediately , <entity class="NE" id=450>Lord Eddard Stark</entity> is asked to attend a meeting of the king 's small council and to change his clothes , but he refuses to the latter . Before that he encounters <entity class="NE" id=451>Jaime Lannister</entity> in the throne room . <entity class="NE" id=452>Jaime</entity> is still unhappy that <entity class="NE" id=453>Eddard</entity> judged him dishonorable for killing the <entity class="NE" id=454>Mad King</entity> , the murderer of <entity class="NE" id=453>Eddard</entity> 's father and brother . <entity class="NE" id=455>Jaime</entity> is unrepentant about it . <entity class="NE" id=456>Eddard</entity> meets the council members : <entity class="NE" id=457>Lord Petyr</entity> `` Littlefinger '' <entity class="NE" id=458>Baelish</entity> , the king 's Master of <entity class="NE" id=459>Coin</entity> and a friend of <entity class="NE" id=456>Eddard</entity> 's wife from childhood ; <entity class="NE" id=460>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> , the king 's adviser in all matters scientific and academic ; <entity class="NE" id=461>Lord Renly Baratheon</entity> , the youngest of the king 's two brothers and <entity class="NE" id=462>Master</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=463>Laws</entity> ; and <entity class="NE" id=464>Varys</entity> , a eunuch and the <entity class="NE" id=462>Master</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=465>Whisperers</entity> ( the head of the king 's intelligence network ) . <entity class="NE" id=466>Varys</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=467>Eddard</entity> that the council members heard about his `` troubles on the <entity class="NE" id=468>Kingsroad</entity> '' and that they pray for <entity class="NE" id=469>Joffrey</entity> 's recovery . <entity class="NE" id=470>Eddard</entity> grimly responds `` It 's a shame no one prayed for the butcher 's boy '' , which visibly upsets <entity class="NE" id=471>Varys</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=472>Eddard</entity> is stunned to learn that the crown is six million <entity class="NE" id=473>Gold Dragons</entity> in debt , half of which is to <entity class="NE" id=474>Lord Tywin Lannister</entity> . To make matters worse , King <entity class="NE" id=475>Robert</entity> has just ordered a lavish tournament to celebrate <entity class="NE" id=476>Eddard</entity> 's appointment . He resolves to advise <entity class="NE" id=477>Robert</entity> to cancel the tournament , but the council is doubtful that the King will listen . <entity class="NE" id=478>Cersei</entity> and her son <entity class="NE" id=479>Joffrey</entity> . Queen Cersei talks to Joffrey about the incident on the river . She tells him that when he is king , the truth will be whatever he decides it will be . <entity class="NE" id=480>Joffrey</entity> thinks there will be trouble with the <entity class="NE" id=481>Starks</entity> , and promises that when he is king , he will double their taxes , force them to contribute to a standing army and , should they object , crush them and install someone loyal , such as his great-uncle <entity class="NE" id=482>Kevan</entity> , as <entity class="NE" id=483>Warden</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=484>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=485>Cersei</entity> points out that the <entity class="NE" id=486>North</entity> is too vast and wild to be militarily conquered by outsiders , and a king needs to be more clever . She also advises him to be kind to his betrothed <entity class="NE" id=487>Sansa Stark</entity> to avoid stirring up trouble for later , and concludes that `` Anyone who is n't us is an enemy . `` . <entity class="NE" id=488>Arya</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=489>Sansa</entity> are still at odds over the incident with <entity class="NE" id=490>Joffrey</entity> and her direwolf . <entity class="NE" id=491>Eddard</entity> explains that <entity class="NE" id=492>Sansa</entity> was put in a difficult position by the king and queen , and while she should n't have lied , winning the long-term approval of <entity class="NE" id=493>Joffrey</entity> , her future husband , was important . <entity class="NE" id=494>Arya</entity> is unhappy with the situation , but <entity class="NE" id=495>Eddard</entity> mollifies her by allowing her to practice with her sword , <entity class="NE" id=496>Needle</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=497>Catelyn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=498>Rodrik</entity> arrive in <entity class="NE" id=499>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=500>Catelyn Catelyn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=501>Ser Rodrik</entity> arrive at <entity class="NE" id=502>King</entity> 's Landing and attempt to sneak into the city , but are spotted by one of <entity class="NE" id=503>Littlefinger</entity> 's men . They are taken to meet Littlefinger at a brothel he owns , where <entity class="NE" id=504>Lord Varys</entity> is also waiting : one of his 'little birds ' told him they were coming . <entity class="NE" id=505>Catelyn</entity> is angered by the way they 've been treated , but asks Littlefinger for aid in finding the people who tried to have <entity class="NE" id=506>Bran</entity> killed . <entity class="NE" id=507>Littlefinger</entity> is able to answer this quickly : the elaborate dagger wielded by the assassin used to be his , but he lost it in a gamble with <entity class="NE" id=508>Tyrion Lannister</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=509>Eddard</entity> threatens <entity class="NE" id=510>Lord Baelish</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=511>Littlefinger</entity> fetches <entity class="NE" id=512>Eddard</entity> to meet his wife , but <entity class="NE" id=512>Eddard</entity> suspects a trick and pushes Littlefinger up against a wall outside the brothel wanting to know what his game is . <entity class="NE" id=513>Catelyn</entity> then appears , and <entity class="NE" id=514>Eddard</entity> is pacified . After hearing her news , he vows to find the truth and expose the <entity class="NE" id=515>Lannisters</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=516>Robert</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=517>Littlefinger</entity> agrees to be his ally in this , for the affection he once bore <entity class="NE" id=518>Catelyn</entity> as a youngster . Ravens arrive at <entity class="NE" id=519>King</entity> 's Landing with news of <entity class="NE" id=520>Bran</entity> 's recovery . <entity class="NE" id=521>Cersei</entity> fears he will expose their secret , but <entity class="NE" id=522>Jaime</entity> comforts her . <entity class="NE" id=523>Jaime</entity> comforts <entity class="NE" id=524>Cersei</entity> . Elsewhere , <entity class="NE" id=525>Robert</entity> swaps old war stories with <entity class="NE" id=526>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> , a distinguished and famous knight and the commander of the <entity class="NE" id=527>Kingsguard</entity> . Summoning <entity class="NE" id=528>Jaime Lannister</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=529>Robert jokingly</entity> questions him about <entity class="NE" id=530>Aerys Targaryen</entity> 's death , wondering if the <entity class="NE" id=531>Mad King</entity> died begging for mercy , but <entity class="NE" id=532>Jaime</entity> rather coldly replies that the master he betrayed died screaming the same words he 'd been saying since the siege of <entity class="NE" id=533>King</entity> 's Landing began : `` Burn them all '' . <entity class="NE" id=534>Eddard</entity> has contracted a swordmaster , <entity class="NE" id=535>Syrio Forel</entity> , the former First Sword of <entity class="NE" id=536>Braavos</entity> , to teach <entity class="NE" id=537>Arya</entity> how to use her sword properly . <entity class="NE" id=538>Arya</entity> is thrilled , and 'the dance ' begins . As <entity class="NE" id=539>Eddard</entity> watches them practice , his pleasure at seeing <entity class="NE" id=540>Arya</entity> happy sours when he realizes that a conflict between the <entity class="NE" id=541>Starks</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=542>Lannisters</entity> may be inevitable ; his daughter may well be training herself for war . In the <entity class="NE" id=543>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=544>Old Old</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=545>Bran</entity> of winter and the <entity class="NE" id=546>Long Night</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=547>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=548>Bran</entity> has awoken but has no memory of his accident . His injuries have left him bedridden and unlikely to walk again . <entity class="NE" id=549>Old Nan</entity> , the oldest servant in the castle , tells <entity class="NE" id=550>Bran</entity> stories to pass the time , but he does n't want her usual heroic stories about the likes of <entity class="NE" id=551>Ser Duncan</entity> the <entity class="NE" id=552>Tall</entity> . She instead speaks of the <entity class="NE" id=553>White Walkers</entity> and the coming of a vast winter that will blanket the world . When <entity class="NE" id=554>Robb</entity> pays a visit , <entity class="NE" id=555>Bran</entity> asks his brother if it is true that his legs are crushed and that he will never walk again . <entity class="NE" id=556>Robb</entity> reluctantly says this is so . <entity class="NE" id=557>Bran</entity> remarks that he would rather be dead . At the <entity class="NE" id=558>Wall</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=559>Castle Black</entity> , the primary redoubt of the <entity class="NE" id=560>Night</entity> 's Watch in the shadow of the <entity class="NE" id=561>Wall</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=562>Jon Snow</entity> shows his worth to the trainer , <entity class="NE" id=563>Ser Alliser Thorne</entity> , by besting several fellow members of the <entity class="NE" id=564>Watch</entity> in the practice yard . <entity class="NE" id=565>Thorne</entity> is disgusted at the poor performance of the others but has no praise for <entity class="NE" id=566>Jon</entity> either , dubbing him <entity class="NE" id=567>Lord Snow</entity> and describing him as `` the least useless person here '' . Watching over the new recruits with <entity class="NE" id=568>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=569>Tyrion</entity> notes <entity class="NE" id=570>Thorne</entity> 's stern and unusual ways , but <entity class="NE" id=571>Jeor</entity> does n't care as he only requires <entity class="NE" id=570>Thorne</entity> to turn the `` thieves and runaways '' into men of the <entity class="NE" id=572>Night's Watch</entity> . Later on , several of the other recruits gang up on <entity class="NE" id=573>Jon</entity> , but the situation is defused by <entity class="NE" id=574>Tyrion</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=575>Tyrion</entity> points out to <entity class="NE" id=576>Jon</entity> that none of the other recruits had the benefit of a skilled master-at-arms to train them , and that <entity class="NE" id=576>Jon</entity> is alienating them through his standoffish attitude and superior combat skills . <entity class="NE" id=577>Benjen</entity> talks with <entity class="NE" id=578>Jon</entity> on the <entity class="NE" id=579>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=580>Benjen Benjen</entity> meets <entity class="NE" id=581>Jon</entity> atop the <entity class="NE" id=582>Wall</entity> and tells him he is going on a ranging in the <entity class="NE" id=583>Haunted Forest</entity> . He refuses to take <entity class="NE" id=584>Jon</entity> with him , telling him he is n't ready , and that here rank and nobility mean nothing : every man must earn everything he gets . Before departing , <entity class="NE" id=585>Benjen</entity> stops by the eating area to farewell <entity class="NE" id=586>Yoren</entity> , a fellow <entity class="NE" id=587>Night</entity> 's Watchman who scouts for new recruits in the capital . <entity class="NE" id=588>Benjen</entity> also scolds Tyrion for his naivety regarding what is north of the <entity class="NE" id=589>Wall</entity> and states that Tyrion has no authority to say what is or is n't beyond the <entity class="NE" id=589>Wall</entity> as he has n't been out there himself . Later , <entity class="NE" id=590>Tyrion</entity> discusses north of the <entity class="NE" id=591>Wall</entity> with <entity class="NE" id=592>Jeor Mormont</entity> and his chief adviser , the ancient and blind <entity class="NE" id=593>Maester Aemon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=594>Jeor</entity> asks for Tyrion to intercede at court and get the <entity class="NE" id=595>Watch</entity> more men as they are dangerously undermanned . <entity class="NE" id=596>Aemon</entity> warns that the Stark words are right : a terrible winter is coming and more dangerous things than just wildlings might come with it ; after all , one of their number swore that the <entity class="NE" id=597>White Walkers</entity> had returned . right up to the moment <entity class="NE" id=598>Ned Stark</entity> cut his head off . <entity class="NE" id=599>Tyrion</entity> admits his skepticism that supernatural creatures might exist , but he agrees to bring word to his queen . Before departing for King 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=600>Tyrion</entity> fulfils an old ambition by climbing to the top of the <entity class="NE" id=601>Wall</entity> and urinating off the edge of it . He and <entity class="NE" id=602>Jon</entity> share a moment of fellowship before <entity class="NE" id=603>Tyrion</entity> departs for the capital in the company of <entity class="NE" id=604>Yoren</entity> . Across the <entity class="NE" id=605>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=606>Daenerys</entity> rides with the khalasar . <entity class="NE" id=607>Daenerys</entity> commands the khalasar to halt on a whim , exercising her growing authority and power . <entity class="NE" id=608>Viserys</entity> does not take well to being commanded and threatens his sister . He is strangled by <entity class="NE" id=609>Rakharo</entity> , a Dothraki warrior wielding a whip . <entity class="NE" id=610>Daenerys</entity> calms the situation and <entity class="NE" id=611>Viserys</entity> is forced to walk , a sign of shame amongst the horse-riding Dothraki . Later , <entity class="NE" id=612>Irri</entity> reveals to Daenerys that Daenerys is pregnant . <entity class="NE" id=613>Daenerys</entity> relays the news to <entity class="NE" id=614>Khal Drogo</entity> and tells him she thinks it will be a boy as they lie naked in each other 's arms . Ser Ser and <entity class="NE" id=615>Rakharo</entity> compare the <entity class="NE" id=616>Westerosi</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=617>Dothraki</entity> ways of battle ; the heavily-armored but slow knights versus the lightly-armored but fast-moving horse-warriors . <entity class="NE" id=618>Jorah</entity> has heard of <entity class="NE" id=619>Rakharo</entity> 's father , a great warrior , but admits that he disgraced his own father , a man of great honor . When he learns that <entity class="NE" id=620>Daenerys</entity> is pregnant , he announces he must split off from the column to ride to the <entity class="NE" id=621>Free City</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=622>Qohor</entity> , but will rejoin them before they reach <entity class="NE" id=623>Vaes Dothrak</entity> .
