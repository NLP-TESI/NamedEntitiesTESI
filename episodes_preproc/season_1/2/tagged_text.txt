<entity class="NE" id=251>Jon Jon</entity> prepares to depart for the <entity class="NE" id=252>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=253>Jon Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=254>Tyrion Lannister</entity> depart <entity class="NE" id=255>Winterfell</entity> for the <entity class="NE" id=256>Wall</entity> , and along the way <entity class="NE" id=257>Jon</entity> discovers his ideas of the <entity class="NE" id=258>Night's Watch</entity> may not match the reality . <entity class="NE" id=259>Eddard Eddard</entity> and his daughters depart for King 's Landing , but an incident on the <entity class="NE" id=260>Kingsroad</entity> threatens to drive a wedge between him and King <entity class="NE" id=261>Robert</entity> . Across the <entity class="NE" id=262>Narrow Sea</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=263>Dothraki</entity> khalasar led by <entity class="NE" id=264>Khal Drogo</entity> have departed <entity class="NE" id=265>Pentos</entity> and are heading east . They travel away from the <entity class="NE" id=266>Free Cities</entity> and into the <entity class="NE" id=267>Dothraki</entity> sea , the long-grassed plains that the <entity class="NE" id=267>Dothraki</entity> call home . <entity class="NE" id=268>Viserys Viserys</entity> accompanies the khalasar , meaning to stay with <entity class="NE" id=269>Drogo</entity> until he fulfills his end of the bargain and provides him with an army with which to invade <entity class="NE" id=270>Westeros</entity> , despite <entity class="NE" id=271>Ser Jorah Mormont</entity> 's suggestion . He tells Viserys that he offended his liege lord , <entity class="NE" id=272>Eddard Stark</entity> , by selling poachers into slavery . When he received word that <entity class="NE" id=273>Eddard</entity> meant to execute him for the crime ( slavery has been illegal in <entity class="NE" id=274>Westeros</entity> for centuries ) , he fled to <entity class="NE" id=275>Essos</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=276>Viserys</entity> laughs at the notion , saying such trivialities would not be punished under his reign . <entity class="NE" id=277>Daenerys</entity> is finding adapting to her new role as khaleesi to be a huge challenge . Only <entity class="NE" id=278>Mormont</entity> offers her some solace ; saying it will become easier . <entity class="NE" id=279>Daenerys</entity> is however fearful of her new husband and it is revealed that their first sexual encounter has left her slightly injured . Fascinated with her gift from <entity class="NE" id=280>Illyrio</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=281>Dany</entity> asks her handmaidens if they have ever heard of dragons surviving in the east . They reply no , but <entity class="NE" id=282>Doreah</entity> , a former pleasure-girl from <entity class="NE" id=283>Lys</entity> , tells her an old story about how there used to be two moons in the sky . One wandered too close to the sun and cracked like an egg , spilling out thousands of dragons into the world . <entity class="NE" id=284>Dany</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=285>Dothraki</entity> handmaidens <entity class="NE" id=286>Irri</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=287>Jhiqui</entity> dismiss the story , saying that the moon is a goddess , wife to the sun . <entity class="NE" id=288>Daenerys</entity> seeks the advice of her handmaid <entity class="NE" id=289>Doreah</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=290>Doreah</entity> instructs <entity class="NE" id=291>Daenerys</entity> on how to please <entity class="NE" id=292>Drogo</entity> in bed but also how to use her skills to gain respect from him . Reminding her , `` you are no slave '' and should not have sex like one . <entity class="NE" id=293>Daenerys</entity> nervously puts these plans into action and is surprised to find <entity class="NE" id=294>Drogo</entity> responsive , particularly once she starts using her body in combination with the <entity class="NE" id=295>Dothraki</entity> language to speak to him . In the <entity class="NE" id=296>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=297>Robb Robb</entity> says farewell to <entity class="NE" id=298>Jon</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=299>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=300>Bran Stark</entity> lies unconscious and badly wounded , his mother by his side . <entity class="NE" id=301>Tyrion Lannister</entity> insists that his nephew Joffrey pay his respects to <entity class="NE" id=302>Lord</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=303>Lady Stark</entity> , since his absence has been noted . When <entity class="NE" id=304>Joffrey</entity> refuses , saying the boy means nothing to him , <entity class="NE" id=305>Tyrion</entity> slaps him three times until he accepts his uncle 's suggestion . <entity class="NE" id=306>Tyrion</entity> then breakfasts with his other family members , informing them of his decision to journey north to see the <entity class="NE" id=307>Wall</entity> before returning to <entity class="NE" id=308>King</entity> 's Landing . He also tells them that <entity class="NE" id=309>Bran</entity> is expected to live and notes <entity class="NE" id=310>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=311>Jaime</entity> 's guarded reactions . <entity class="NE" id=312>Cersei</entity> visits <entity class="NE" id=313>Catelyn Stark</entity> , sitting by her son 's side , and tells her that her first child , a beautiful , black-haired boy , died of a fever . She and <entity class="NE" id=314>Robert</entity> were grief-stricken and her prayers and tears were for naught . She offers to pray for <entity class="NE" id=315>Bran</entity> 's survival , hoping that this time the gods will listen . <entity class="NE" id=316>Jon Jon</entity> has <entity class="NE" id=317>Winterfell</entity> 's blacksmith , <entity class="NE" id=318>Mikken</entity> , forge a light sword for his sister , <entity class="NE" id=319>Arya</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=320>Arya</entity> is excited by the gift and names it <entity class="NE" id=321>Needle</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=322>Jon</entity> also gives her advice on how to best use the weapon : `` Stick them with the pointy end . '' <entity class="NE" id=323>Jon</entity> urges <entity class="NE" id=324>Arya</entity> to practice every chance she gets . <entity class="NE" id=325>Jon</entity> then says goodbye to the comatose <entity class="NE" id=326>Bran</entity> , before departing at his stepmother 's cold request . <entity class="NE" id=327>Eddard</entity> then says his goodbyes to his son and to <entity class="NE" id=328>Catelyn</entity> , who is angered at his departure while <entity class="NE" id=329>Bran</entity> remains ill . The two parties depart <entity class="NE" id=330>Winterfell</entity> . The parties depart <entity class="NE" id=331>Winterfell</entity> : <entity class="NE" id=332>Jon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=333>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=334>Benjen Stark</entity> to the <entity class="NE" id=335>Wall</entity> ; and <entity class="NE" id=336>Eddard</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=337>Arya</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=338>Sansa</entity> and the royal party south to <entity class="NE" id=339>King</entity> 's Landing . At their parting <entity class="NE" id=340>Eddard</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=341>Jon</entity> that , though he does not have <entity class="NE" id=340>Eddard</entity> 's name , he has his blood . He also promises <entity class="NE" id=342>Jon</entity> to tell him about his mother the next time they meet . <entity class="NE" id=343>Eddard Eddard</entity> says goodbye to his bastard son . Days later , on the <entity class="NE" id=344>Kingsroad</entity> south to the capital , King <entity class="NE" id=345>Robert Baratheon</entity> calls a halt to discuss with <entity class="NE" id=346>Eddard</entity> some dire news that has just arrived . <entity class="NE" id=347>Robert</entity> 's spies have learned of <entity class="NE" id=348>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> 's marriage to <entity class="NE" id=349>Khal Drogo</entity> , whose khalasar is reported to number over one hundred thousand warriors . <entity class="NE" id=350>Eddard</entity> points out that the <entity class="NE" id=351>Dothraki</entity> can not cross the <entity class="NE" id=352>Narrow Sea</entity> , as they have no ships , but <entity class="NE" id=353>Robert</entity> is concerned that the <entity class="NE" id=354>Seven Kingdoms</entity> will soon face another war . A curious <entity class="NE" id=355>Robert</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=356>Eddard</entity> about <entity class="NE" id=357>Wylla</entity> , the mother of his bastard son , but <entity class="NE" id=356>Eddard</entity> refuses to enlighten him . <entity class="NE" id=358>Robert</entity> reminds him that they were in the middle of a war and no one knew if they would ever return to their families . In <entity class="NE" id=359>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=360>Catelyn</entity> 's refusal to leave <entity class="NE" id=361>Bran</entity> 's side is starting to cause problems for the smooth running of the castle . <entity class="NE" id=362>Robb</entity> offers to work with <entity class="NE" id=363>Maester Luwin</entity> to put the castle to rights . There is then a fire in part of the castle , but this proves to be a distraction to allow an assassin to attempt to finish off <entity class="NE" id=364>Bran</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=365>Catelyn</entity> holds the assassin off long enough for <entity class="NE" id=366>Bran</entity> 's direwolf to enter the chamber and tear out the assassin 's throat . <entity class="NE" id=367>Jon</entity> and Tyrion discussing matters . Traveling north , <entity class="NE" id=368>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=369>Tyrion</entity> talk , and <entity class="NE" id=369>Tyrion</entity> reveals that he reads books to sharpen his mind , his greatest asset and weapon . As it travels north , the party is joined by several , new recruits â€” rapists who chose to `` take the black , '' rather than face the knife . <entity class="NE" id=370>Tyrion</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=371>Jon</entity> that the <entity class="NE" id=372>Night's Watch</entity> is not a noble institution of glorious knights defending the realm against the horrors lurking beyond the <entity class="NE" id=373>Wall</entity> , but a dumping ground for the unwanted and for criminals . In <entity class="NE" id=374>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=375>Catelyn</entity> goes to the tower from where <entity class="NE" id=376>Bran</entity> fell and finds a strand of blonde hair on the floor . She summons <entity class="NE" id=377>Robb</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=378>Theon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=379>Luwin</entity> and the castle master at arms , <entity class="NE" id=380>Ser Rodrik Cassel</entity> and tells them that she suspects that the <entity class="NE" id=381>Lannisters</entity> tried to kill <entity class="NE" id=382>Bran</entity> because he might have seen something in the tower . <entity class="NE" id=383>Robb</entity> and Theon are all for making war , but <entity class="NE" id=384>Luwin</entity> schools them to caution . <entity class="NE" id=385>Catelyn</entity> decides that <entity class="NE" id=386>Ned</entity> must know the truth and resolves to travel south to <entity class="NE" id=387>King</entity> 's Landing and meet him there . <entity class="NE" id=388>Ser Ser</entity> will go as escort , while <entity class="NE" id=389>Robb</entity> will take charge of the castle in her absence . The <entity class="NE" id=390>Wall</entity> , as seen by <entity class="NE" id=391>Jon</entity> 's party . <entity class="NE" id=392>Jon</entity> 's party crests a rise and sees the <entity class="NE" id=393>Wall</entity> before them . <entity class="NE" id=394>Benjen</entity> welcomes them , and <entity class="NE" id=395>Tyrion</entity> seems impressed by the <entity class="NE" id=396>Wall</entity> 's sheer size . On the <entity class="NE" id=397>Kingsroad</entity> , the royal party reaches the <entity class="NE" id=398>Crossroads Inn</entity> , a noted waystop on the way south to the capital . <entity class="NE" id=399>Prince Prince</entity> 's bodyguard , <entity class="NE" id=400>Sandor Clegane</entity> , known as `` the <entity class="NE" id=401>Hound</entity> , '' a man with half his face burned in a mysterious accident , introduces <entity class="NE" id=402>Sansa</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=403>Ser Ilyn Payne</entity> , the king 's headsman , a frightening-looking man who had his tongue torn out on the orders of the <entity class="NE" id=404>Mad King</entity> many years ago . <entity class="NE" id=405>Joffrey</entity> saves <entity class="NE" id=406>Sansa</entity> from this unpleasantness and takes her for a walk along the riverbank . They find Arya practicing her sword work with the son of the party 's butcher , <entity class="NE" id=407>Mycah</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=408>Joffrey</entity> pretends to take offense at <entity class="NE" id=409>Mycah</entity> using a sword on the sister of his betrothed and starts to gleefully cut <entity class="NE" id=409>Mycah</entity> 's face with his sword , but an outraged Arya hits him on the head with a stick . <entity class="NE" id=410>Joffrey</entity> quickly becomes violent and threatens <entity class="NE" id=411>Arya</entity> at sword point , but before he can hurt her , <entity class="NE" id=411>Arya</entity> 's direwolf , <entity class="NE" id=412>Nymeria</entity> , attacks <entity class="NE" id=410>Joffrey</entity> , biting at his arm . <entity class="NE" id=413>Mycah</entity> runs off , and <entity class="NE" id=414>Arya</entity> throws <entity class="NE" id=415>Joffrey</entity> 's sword in the river before running off herself . <entity class="NE" id=416>Sansa</entity> tries to help <entity class="NE" id=417>Joffrey</entity> , but he spitefully tells her to leave him alone and go for help . <entity class="NE" id=418>Arya</entity> , knowing that <entity class="NE" id=419>Nymeria</entity> will be punished for injuring the prince , forces the direwolf to flee by throwing a rock at her . She is then taken before the King , who is angered that a minor fracas has become a major incident , with his wife and new Hand blaming one another 's children . He decides to let Ned discipline <entity class="NE" id=420>Arya</entity> while he will do the same to <entity class="NE" id=421>Joffrey</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=422>Cersei</entity> demands that the direwolf be executed . When <entity class="NE" id=423>Nymeria</entity> can not be found , <entity class="NE" id=424>Cersei</entity> spitefully requests that <entity class="NE" id=425>Sansa</entity> 's direwolf <entity class="NE" id=426>Lady</entity> be killed instead , and <entity class="NE" id=427>Robert</entity> acquiesces , upsetting <entity class="NE" id=425>Sansa</entity> and angering <entity class="NE" id=428>Arya</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=429>Furious</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=430>Eddard</entity> attends to the matter himself , passing the <entity class="NE" id=431>Hound</entity> arriving with <entity class="NE" id=432>Mycah</entity> 's bloodied corpse . <entity class="NE" id=433>Eddard</entity> is shocked and disgusted , and when he asks if the <entity class="NE" id=434>Hound</entity> ran <entity class="NE" id=435>Mycah</entity> down , the <entity class="NE" id=434>Hound</entity> responds `` He ran , but not very fast . '' <entity class="NE" id=436>Eddard</entity> kills <entity class="NE" id=437>Lady</entity> with a dagger , and hundreds of miles away , <entity class="NE" id=438>Bran</entity> awakens .
