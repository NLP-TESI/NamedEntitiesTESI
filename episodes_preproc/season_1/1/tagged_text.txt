King <entity class="NE" id=0>Robert Baratheon</entity> majestically arrives in <entity class="NE" id=1>Winterfell</entity> , the home of his old and trusted friend , <entity class="NE" id=2>Eddard Stark</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3>Warden</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4>North</entity> , with an important offer . On the eastern continent , the exiled <entity class="NE" id=5>Princess Daenerys Targaryen</entity> marries <entity class="NE" id=6>Khal Drogo</entity> , a warlord of the <entity class="NE" id=7>Dothraki</entity> with tens of thousands of warriors at his command . Her brother , <entity class="NE" id=8>Viserys</entity> , callously plans to win <entity class="NE" id=9>Drogo</entity> 's allegiance with the marriage , so that he may return home to <entity class="NE" id=10>Westeros</entity> and reclaim the <entity class="NE" id=11>Iron Throne</entity> , which was seized by force from his father by <entity class="NE" id=12>Robert</entity> . In the frozen lands , beyond the <entity class="NE" id=13>Wall</entity> , the wildlings are on the move , to the alarm of the <entity class="NE" id=14>Night's Watch</entity> . But even farther north , something colder and darker is beginning to stir . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=15>Wall</entity> . Three rangers of the <entity class="NE" id=16>Night</entity> 's Watch : <entity class="NE" id=17>Ser Waymar Royce</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=18>Will</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=19>Gared</entity> depart from the <entity class="NE" id=20>Wall</entity> to investigate reports of wildlings in the <entity class="NE" id=21>Haunted Forest</entity> which lies to the north , Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=20>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=22>Will</entity> , the best scout in the group , discovers a number of wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange , ritualistic fashion on the ground . Wight of wildling girl . He also finds a dead wildling girl pinned to a tree . He reports back to the others . Ser Ser overrides the older <entity class="NE" id=23>Gared</entity> 's advice that they return to <entity class="NE" id=24>Castle Black</entity> to report the situation to their superiors and instead insists on seeing the corpses for himself , to determine what killed them . When they reach the site , the bodies have disappeared . Will scouts around for clues , but <entity class="NE" id=25>Gared</entity> finds a bloody piece of clothing buried under the snow . Further investigations are curtailed when a tall , humanoid figure with glowing blue eyes , a <entity class="NE" id=26>White Walker</entity> , arrives and kills <entity class="NE" id=27>Ser Waymar</entity> with ease . Gared attempts to escape but is caught and killed . <entity class="NE" id=28>Will</entity> , in extreme horror , sees the dead wildling girl from earlier now walking with blue eyes , and also witnesses <entity class="NE" id=29>Gared</entity> 's death , with the <entity class="NE" id=30>White Walker</entity> tossing his severed head at <entity class="NE" id=28>Will</entity> 's feet . In the <entity class="NE" id=31>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=32>Ned Ned</entity> draws his sword . Some time later , <entity class="NE" id=33>Will</entity> has fled south of the Wall in terror , rather than return to warn <entity class="NE" id=34>Castle Black</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=35>White Walker</entity> threat . He is apprehended by outriders loyal to <entity class="HSE" id=36>House Stark</entity> , the wardens of the <entity class="NE" id=37>North</entity> , and is taken to <entity class="NE" id=38>Lord Eddard Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=39>Lord Lord</entity> , in the courtyard watching his son , <entity class="NE" id=40>Bran Stark</entity> at archery training , decrees that as a deserter from the <entity class="NE" id=41>Watch</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=42>Will</entity> is an oathbreaker and must die . Will accepts his fate , but tells <entity class="NE" id=43>Eddard</entity> about the <entity class="NE" id=44>Walkers</entity> first and asks that word be sent back to his mother . <entity class="NE" id=45>Eddard</entity> carries out the execution himself , using the ancestral <entity class="NE" id=46>Valyrian</entity> blade of their house , Ice . Two of <entity class="NE" id=47>Eddard</entity> 's trueborn sons , 17-year-old <entity class="NE" id=48>Robb</entity> and 10-year-old <entity class="NE" id=49>Bran</entity> , accompany him to the execution along with his bastard son <entity class="NE" id=50>Jon Snow</entity> , his ward , <entity class="NE" id=51>Theon Greyjoy</entity> , the master-at-arms <entity class="NE" id=52>Rodrik Cassel</entity> and his leading guard <entity class="NE" id=53>Jory Cassel</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=54>Young Young</entity> witnesses an execution for the first time without flinching , earning praise from <entity class="NE" id=55>Jon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=56>Eddard</entity> explains to Bran that the reason he was made to execute <entity class="NE" id=57>Will</entity> was because the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword . When <entity class="NE" id=58>Bran</entity> asks his father about <entity class="NE" id=59>Will</entity> 's talk of <entity class="NE" id=60>White Walkers</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=61>Eddard</entity> dismisses it as a madman 's ramblings , insisting that the Walkers have been gone for centuries . The party sets out to return to <entity class="NE" id=62>Winterfell</entity> . The Starks come across the <entity class="NE" id=63>Direwolves</entity> . On the way back to the castle , the party finds a stag dead in the road , partially disemboweled . Looking for what killed it , they find a dead female direwolf , killed with a stag antler piece broken off in her throat . The female died after giving birth , and her five pups huddle by the corpse for warmth . <entity class="NE" id=64>Theon</entity> advocates killing the pups , but <entity class="NE" id=65>Jon Snow</entity> convinces his father that this is an omen : the direwolf is the symbol of <entity class="HSE" id=66>House Stark</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=67>Eddard</entity> has five trueborn children . With <entity class="NE" id=68>Bran</entity> looking on beseechingly , <entity class="NE" id=69>Eddard</entity> agrees that his children should have the pups , but only if they raise them themselves with no help from the servants . Just as the party leaves , <entity class="NE" id=70>Jon</entity> finds a sixth pup , an albino runt of the litter . Theon mockingly points out that this one belongs to <entity class="NE" id=71>Jon</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=72>King</entity> 's Landing , the capital city of the <entity class="NE" id=73>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , the bells ring out to commemorate the death of <entity class="NE" id=74>Lord Jon Arryn</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=75>Hand</entity> of the King . As the <entity class="NE" id=76>Silent Sisters</entity> prepare his body for burial , <entity class="NE" id=77>Queen Cersei Lannister</entity> looks on . She is worried that <entity class="NE" id=78>Jon</entity> discovered something he should n't have , and may have told someone . She confesses her fears to her twin brother , <entity class="NE" id=79>Ser Jaime Lannister</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=80>Kingsguard</entity> , but he tells her not to worry , since if the King knew the truth they 'd be dead already . She tells him he should be the new Hand of the King , but he does n't want the job . He considers it too much work . <entity class="NE" id=81>Cersei</entity> accuses him of taking nothing seriously . A raven bears news of <entity class="NE" id=82>Jon Arryn</entity> 's death to <entity class="NE" id=83>Winterfell</entity> , where <entity class="NE" id=84>Lady Catelyn Stark</entity> informs <entity class="NE" id=85>Eddard</entity> . He is particularly stricken because <entity class="NE" id=86>Arryn</entity> served as a father-figure to him , when he was fostered at the <entity class="NE" id=87>Eyrie</entity> . She also tells him that King <entity class="NE" id=88>Robert Baratheon</entity> and much of the royal court rides for <entity class="NE" id=89>Winterfell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=90>Eddard</entity> realizes that King <entity class="NE" id=91>Robert</entity> means to name him as the <entity class="NE" id=92>Hand</entity> to replace <entity class="NE" id=93>Jon Arryn</entity> . He ponders refusing , feeling his place is at <entity class="NE" id=94>Winterfell</entity> . Over the next few weeks the Stark children grow used to their rapidly-growing direwolves : <entity class="NE" id=95>Robb</entity> names his <entity class="NE" id=96>Grey Wind</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=97>Sansa</entity> calls hers <entity class="NE" id=98>Lady</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=99>Arya</entity> names hers <entity class="NE" id=100>Nymeria</entity> after a great warrior-queen . <entity class="NE" id=101>Jon</entity> names his Ghost , for his white color and uncanny silence . <entity class="NE" id=102>Bran</entity> calls his Summer and six-year-old <entity class="NE" id=103>Rickon</entity> names his wolf <entity class="NE" id=104>Shaggydog</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=105>Bran</entity> 's mother catches him climbing on the rooftops of the castle , just as the royal party comes into view . He promises to stop , but his mother knows he is lying . <entity class="NE" id=106>Winterfell</entity> prepares for guests . <entity class="NE" id=107>Catelyn Catelyn</entity> wants to make sure that <entity class="NE" id=108>Tyrion Lannister</entity> , a great reader , has enough candles , and the young men of the house get groomed , as they gossip about the queen , a reportedly great beauty . <entity class="NE" id=109>Winterfell</entity> gathers to greet the royal party . All of <entity class="NE" id=110>Winterfell</entity> gathers in the courtyard as the royal party approaches . <entity class="NE" id=111>Arya</entity> is late and annoys Sansa by not being silent and respectful when they arrive . King <entity class="NE" id=112>Robert</entity> rides in with his knights , while <entity class="NE" id=113>Queen Cersei</entity> is in a large wheelhouse . <entity class="NE" id=114>Lord Lord</entity> presents his household to King <entity class="NE" id=115>Robert</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=116>Eddard</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=117>Robert greet</entity> each other warmly , and then <entity class="NE" id=118>Robert</entity> demands to see the crypts and pay his respects to <entity class="NE" id=116>Eddard</entity> 's deceased sister , <entity class="NE" id=119>Lyanna</entity> , much to <entity class="NE" id=120>Queen Cersei</entity> 's impatience . After <entity class="NE" id=121>Robert</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=122>Eddard</entity> depart , <entity class="NE" id=123>Cersei</entity> sends <entity class="NE" id=124>Jaime</entity> to find their younger brother <entity class="NE" id=125>Tyrion</entity> , who is a dwarf . `` The Imp '' has found his way to the brothel in the town outside <entity class="NE" id=126>Winterfell</entity> , where he enjoys the attentions of a prostitute named <entity class="NE" id=127>Ros</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=128>Jaime</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=129>Tyrion</entity> , a man of limited height but with immense appetites , that he will be needed at the feast that night . <entity class="NE" id=130>Jaime</entity> has hired three more prostitutes for <entity class="NE" id=131>Tyrion</entity> , to hurry things along . <entity class="NE" id=132>Lyanna</entity> 's statue in the crypts of <entity class="NE" id=133>Winterfell</entity> . In the crypts <entity class="NE" id=134>Robert</entity> offers up his prayers at the tomb of <entity class="NE" id=135>Lyanna Stark</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=136>Eddard</entity> 's younger sister , whom <entity class="NE" id=134>Robert</entity> was betrothed to before she was kidnapped by <entity class="NE" id=137>Prince Rhaegar Targaryen</entity> and died shortly after being rescued . He tells <entity class="NE" id=138>Eddard</entity> that in his dreams he kills <entity class="NE" id=139>Rhaegar</entity> every night anew . <entity class="NE" id=140>Eddard</entity> reminds him that <entity class="HSE" id=141>House Targaryen</entity> was destroyed , but <entity class="NE" id=142>Robert</entity> replies : `` not all of them . `` . <entity class="NE" id=143>Robert</entity> formally offers <entity class="NE" id=144>Eddard</entity> the role of <entity class="NE" id=145>Hand</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=144>Eddard</entity> asks for time to consider . <entity class="NE" id=146>Robert</entity> agrees , but offers a sweetener : the hand of his son , <entity class="NE" id=147>Joffrey</entity> , in marriage to <entity class="NE" id=148>Eddard</entity> 's daughter , <entity class="NE" id=149>Sansa</entity> . A great feast is held and <entity class="NE" id=150>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=151>Catelyn</entity> exchange cordial words . <entity class="NE" id=152>Cersei</entity> seems more impressed by <entity class="NE" id=153>Sansa</entity> , thinking that she will be a great hit at court . Outside the feast , <entity class="NE" id=154>Jon Snow</entity> works at his sword practice , angry that <entity class="NE" id=155>Catelyn</entity> thought it would be inappropriate that a bastard should attend . His uncle <entity class="NE" id=156>Benjen Stark</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=157>First Ranger</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=158>Night's Watch</entity> , arrives to join the feast , and <entity class="NE" id=159>Jon</entity> asks him to take him back to the <entity class="NE" id=160>Wall</entity> with him . <entity class="NE" id=161>Benjen</entity> agrees to consider it . <entity class="NE" id=162>Tyrion Lannister</entity> then arrives and talks to <entity class="NE" id=163>Jon</entity> , suggesting that he is too pricklish and quick to take offense when his illegitimacy is pointed out . He should take the insult and wear it like armor , so that no one can hurt him with it . When <entity class="NE" id=164>Jon</entity> angrily asks Tyrion what he knows about it , <entity class="NE" id=165>Tyrion</entity> replies that `` all dwarfs are bastards in their father 's eyes . `` . <entity class="NE" id=166>Eddard</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=167>Catelyn</entity> receive a letter in the night , delivered to <entity class="NE" id=168>Maester Luwin</entity> by a messenger from the <entity class="NE" id=169>Eyrie</entity> . The letter is from <entity class="NE" id=170>Catelyn</entity> 's sister , <entity class="NE" id=171>Lady Lysa Arryn</entity> , the widow of <entity class="NE" id=172>Jon Arryn</entity> . In the letter , <entity class="NE" id=173>Lysa</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=174>Jon Arryn</entity> was murdered by the <entity class="NE" id=175>Lannisters</entity> and that they plan to conspire against King <entity class="NE" id=176>Robert</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=177>Luwin</entity> counsels that <entity class="NE" id=178>Eddard</entity> should accept <entity class="NE" id=179>Robert</entity> 's offer to be <entity class="NE" id=180>Hand</entity> , so he can investigate the truth of the matter and protect the King . <entity class="NE" id=181>Eddard</entity> , while he would prefer to stay at <entity class="NE" id=182>Winterfell</entity> , agrees with <entity class="NE" id=183>Luwin</entity> and accepts the offer . The next morning <entity class="NE" id=184>Eddard</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=185>Robert</entity> go hunting , leaving the castle largely empty . <entity class="NE" id=186>Bran</entity> indulges in some climbing but , while climbing a broken tower , he hears someone moaning . He peers through a window and finds the queen and her brother engaged in a sexual act . <entity class="NE" id=187>Cersei</entity> spots him and warns <entity class="NE" id=188>Jaime</entity> , who grabs <entity class="NE" id=189>Bran</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=190>Jaime</entity> looks out the window to make sure nobody else is watching and only sees Summer . He turns to <entity class="NE" id=191>Bran</entity> and asks how old he is . When <entity class="NE" id=192>Bran</entity> replies `` ten , '' Jaime remarks with a sigh , `` The things I do for love . '' With that , he pushes <entity class="NE" id=193>Bran</entity> out of the window . Across the <entity class="NE" id=194>Narrow Sea</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=195>Free City</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=196>Pentos</entity> , across the <entity class="NE" id=197>Narrow Sea</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=198>Viserys</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=199>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> enjoy the hospitality of <entity class="NE" id=200>Magister Illyrio Mopatis</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=201>Viserys</entity> has arranged to wed his sister <entity class="NE" id=202>Daenerys</entity> ( also called `` Dany '' ) to <entity class="NE" id=203>Khal Drogo</entity> , the warlord of a Dothraki khalasar of forty thousand warriors . In return , <entity class="NE" id=204>Drogo</entity> will give Viserys the army he needs to reclaim the <entity class="NE" id=205>Iron Throne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=206>Viserys</entity> prepares <entity class="NE" id=207>Daenerys</entity> for meeting the <entity class="NE" id=208>Khal</entity> . He tells her what a beautiful young woman she has turned into , and slips off her dress and fondles her breast . She is silent and looks away as if pretending it is n't happening . She steps into a hot bath that has just been poured . This greatly distresses her maid who believes the water will scald her . However , <entity class="NE" id=209>Daenerys</entity> seems not to notice it and appears to be unharmed . <entity class="NE" id=210>Drogo</entity> arrives in <entity class="NE" id=211>Pentos</entity> and approves of <entity class="NE" id=212>Daenerys</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=213>Illyrio</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=214>Viserys</entity> discuss the quest to sail back to <entity class="NE" id=215>Westoros</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=214>Viserys</entity> inquirers when the wedding will take place . <entity class="NE" id=216>Daenerys</entity> is not pleased with the arrangement and blurts out that she does not want to marry <entity class="NE" id=217>Drogo</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=218>Viserys</entity> insists that she will , because in return <entity class="NE" id=219>Drogo</entity> will give him the army he needs to retake their father 's throne from <entity class="NE" id=220>Robert Baratheon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=221>Viserys</entity> adds that he would let her be raped by all forty thousand of <entity class="NE" id=222>Drogo</entity> 's men and their horses if it meant getting his throne back . A short time later , <entity class="NE" id=223>Drogo</entity> arrives at <entity class="NE" id=224>Illyrio</entity> 's estate . After taking a glance at <entity class="NE" id=225>Daenerys</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=226>Drogo</entity> rides away without having to dismount from his horse . <entity class="NE" id=227>Viserys</entity> is concerned , but <entity class="NE" id=228>Illyrio</entity> assures him that , if he did not approve of <entity class="NE" id=229>Daenerys</entity> , they would have known . <entity class="NE" id=230>Daenerys</entity> in her wedding dress . Later , <entity class="NE" id=231>Daenerys</entity> marries <entity class="NE" id=232>Khal Drogo</entity> and a great celebration is held . Several people die in impromptu duels , which <entity class="NE" id=233>Illyrio</entity> says is a good sign : a Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair . The bride and groom receive many gifts , but for <entity class="NE" id=234>Dany</entity> , two are particularly interesting . The first is a box containing three beautiful stones . According to <entity class="NE" id=235>Illyrio</entity> , these are dragon eggs from the <entity class="NE" id=236>Shadow Lands</entity> beyond <entity class="NE" id=237>Asshai</entity> that have turned to stone with the passing of time . <entity class="NE" id=238>Dany</entity> appears to feel some connection with the eggs , but brushes it off for the time being . The second is a selection of books containing stories and songs from the <entity class="NE" id=239>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , given by <entity class="NE" id=240>Ser Jorah Mormont</entity> , an exiled knight of <entity class="HSE" id=241>House Mormont</entity> . Ser Ser swears fealty to <entity class="NE" id=242>Viserys</entity> as King and offers him his support and advice , which is accepted . For his gift , <entity class="NE" id=243>Drogo</entity> gives Daenerys a beautiful white stallion . <entity class="NE" id=244>Viserys</entity> asks his sister to make <entity class="NE" id=245>Drogo</entity> happy . <entity class="NE" id=246>Drogo</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=247>Daenerys</entity> ride down to the shore and consummate their marriage on the beach at sunset . <entity class="NE" id=248>Daenerys</entity> is visibly upset and terrified .
