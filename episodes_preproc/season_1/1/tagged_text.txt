King <entity id=0>Robert Baratheon</entity> majestically arrives in <entity id=1>Winterfell</entity> , the home of his old and trusted friend , <entity id=2>Eddard Stark</entity> , <entity id=3>Warden</entity> of the <entity id=4>North</entity> , with an important offer . On the eastern continent , the exiled <entity id=5>Princess Daenerys Targaryen</entity> marries <entity id=6>Khal Drogo</entity> , a warlord of the <entity id=7>Dothraki</entity> with tens of thousands of warriors at his command . Her brother , <entity id=8>Viserys</entity> , callously plans to win <entity id=9>Drogo</entity> 's allegiance with the marriage , so that he may return home to <entity id=10>Westeros</entity> and reclaim the <entity id=11>Iron Throne</entity> , which was seized by force from his father by <entity id=12>Robert</entity> . In the frozen lands , beyond the <entity id=13>Wall</entity> , the wildlings are on the move , to the alarm of the <entity id=14>Night's Watch</entity> . But even farther north , something colder and darker is beginning to stir . Beyond the <entity id=15>Wall</entity> . Three rangers of the <entity id=16>Night</entity> 's Watch : <entity id=17>Ser Waymar Royce</entity> , <entity id=18>Will</entity> , and <entity id=19>Gared</entity> depart from the <entity id=20>Wall</entity> to investigate reports of wildlings in the <entity id=21>Haunted Forest</entity> which lies to the north , Beyond the <entity id=20>Wall</entity> . <entity id=22>Will</entity> , the best scout in the group , discovers a number of wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange , ritualistic fashion on the ground . Wight of wildling girl . He also finds a dead wildling girl pinned to a tree . He reports back to the others . <entity id=23>Ser Ser</entity> overrides the older <entity id=24>Gared</entity> 's advice that they return to <entity id=25>Castle Black</entity> to report the situation to their superiors and instead insists on seeing the corpses for himself , to determine what killed them . When they reach the site , the bodies have disappeared . Will scouts around for clues , but <entity id=26>Gared</entity> finds a bloody piece of clothing buried under the snow . Further investigations are curtailed when a tall , humanoid figure with glowing blue eyes , a <entity id=27>White Walker</entity> , arrives and kills <entity id=28>Ser Waymar</entity> with ease . Gared attempts to escape but is caught and killed . <entity id=29>Will</entity> , in extreme horror , sees the dead wildling girl from earlier now walking with blue eyes , and also witnesses <entity id=30>Gared</entity> 's death , with the <entity id=31>White Walker</entity> tossing his severed head at <entity id=29>Will</entity> 's feet . In the <entity id=32>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity id=33>Ned Ned</entity> draws his sword . Some time later , <entity id=34>Will</entity> has fled south of the Wall in terror , rather than return to warn <entity id=35>Castle Black</entity> of the <entity id=36>White Walker</entity> threat . He is apprehended by outriders loyal to <entity id=37>House Stark</entity> , the wardens of the <entity id=38>North</entity> , and is taken to <entity id=39>Lord Eddard Stark</entity> . <entity id=40>Lord Lord</entity> , in the courtyard watching his son , <entity id=41>Bran Stark</entity> at archery training , decrees that as a deserter from the <entity id=42>Watch</entity> , <entity id=43>Will</entity> is an oathbreaker and must die . Will accepts his fate , but tells <entity id=44>Eddard</entity> about the <entity id=45>Walkers</entity> first and asks that word be sent back to his mother . <entity id=46>Eddard</entity> carries out the execution himself , using the ancestral <entity id=47>Valyrian</entity> blade of their house , Ice . Two of <entity id=48>Eddard</entity> 's trueborn sons , 17-year-old <entity id=49>Robb</entity> and 10-year-old <entity id=50>Bran</entity> , accompany him to the execution along with his bastard son <entity id=51>Jon Snow</entity> , his ward , <entity id=52>Theon Greyjoy</entity> , the master-at-arms <entity id=53>Rodrik Cassel</entity> and his leading guard <entity id=54>Jory Cassel</entity> . <entity id=55>Young Young</entity> witnesses an execution for the first time without flinching , earning praise from <entity id=56>Jon</entity> . <entity id=57>Eddard</entity> explains to Bran that the reason he was made to execute <entity id=58>Will</entity> was because the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword . When <entity id=59>Bran</entity> asks his father about <entity id=60>Will</entity> 's talk of <entity id=61>White Walkers</entity> , <entity id=62>Eddard</entity> dismisses it as a madman 's ramblings , insisting that the Walkers have been gone for centuries . The party sets out to return to <entity id=63>Winterfell</entity> . The Starks come across the <entity id=64>Direwolves</entity> . On the way back to the castle , the party finds a stag dead in the road , partially disemboweled . Looking for what killed it , they find a dead female direwolf , killed with a stag antler piece broken off in her throat . The female died after giving birth , and her five pups huddle by the corpse for warmth . <entity id=65>Theon</entity> advocates killing the pups , but <entity id=66>Jon Snow</entity> convinces his father that this is an omen : the direwolf is the symbol of <entity id=67>House Stark</entity> , and <entity id=68>Eddard</entity> has five trueborn children . With <entity id=69>Bran</entity> looking on beseechingly , <entity id=70>Eddard</entity> agrees that his children should have the pups , but only if they raise them themselves with no help from the servants . Just as the party leaves , <entity id=71>Jon</entity> finds a sixth pup , an albino runt of the litter . Theon mockingly points out that this one belongs to <entity id=72>Jon</entity> . In <entity id=73>King</entity> 's Landing , the capital city of the <entity id=74>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , the bells ring out to commemorate the death of <entity id=75>Lord Jon Arryn</entity> , the <entity id=76>Hand</entity> of the King . As the <entity id=77>Silent Sisters</entity> prepare his body for burial , <entity id=78>Queen Cersei Lannister</entity> looks on . She is worried that <entity id=79>Jon</entity> discovered something he should n't have , and may have told someone . She confesses her fears to her twin brother , <entity id=80>Ser Jaime Lannister</entity> of the <entity id=81>Kingsguard</entity> , but he tells her not to worry , since if the King knew the truth they 'd be dead already . She tells him he should be the new Hand of the King , but he does n't want the job . He considers it too much work . <entity id=82>Cersei</entity> accuses him of taking nothing seriously . A raven bears news of <entity id=83>Jon Arryn</entity> 's death to <entity id=84>Winterfell</entity> , where <entity id=85>Lady Catelyn Stark</entity> informs <entity id=86>Eddard</entity> . He is particularly stricken because <entity id=87>Arryn</entity> served as a father-figure to him , when he was fostered at the <entity id=88>Eyrie</entity> . She also tells him that King <entity id=89>Robert Baratheon</entity> and much of the royal court rides for <entity id=90>Winterfell</entity> . <entity id=91>Eddard</entity> realizes that King <entity id=92>Robert</entity> means to name him as the <entity id=93>Hand</entity> to replace <entity id=94>Jon Arryn</entity> . He ponders refusing , feeling his place is at <entity id=95>Winterfell</entity> . Over the next few weeks the Stark children grow used to their rapidly-growing direwolves : <entity id=96>Robb</entity> names his <entity id=97>Grey Wind</entity> , <entity id=98>Sansa</entity> calls hers <entity id=99>Lady</entity> , and <entity id=100>Arya</entity> names hers <entity id=101>Nymeria</entity> after a great warrior-queen . <entity id=102>Jon</entity> names his Ghost , for his white color and uncanny silence . <entity id=103>Bran</entity> calls his Summer and six-year-old <entity id=104>Rickon</entity> names his wolf <entity id=105>Shaggydog</entity> . <entity id=106>Bran</entity> 's mother catches him climbing on the rooftops of the castle , just as the royal party comes into view . He promises to stop , but his mother knows he is lying . <entity id=107>Winterfell</entity> prepares for guests . <entity id=108>Catelyn Catelyn</entity> wants to make sure that <entity id=109>Tyrion Lannister</entity> , a great reader , has enough candles , and the young men of the house get groomed , as they gossip about the queen , a reportedly great beauty . <entity id=110>Winterfell</entity> gathers to greet the royal party . All of <entity id=111>Winterfell</entity> gathers in the courtyard as the royal party approaches . <entity id=112>Arya</entity> is late and annoys Sansa by not being silent and respectful when they arrive . King <entity id=113>Robert</entity> rides in with his knights , while <entity id=114>Queen Cersei</entity> is in a large wheelhouse . <entity id=115>Lord Lord</entity> presents his household to King <entity id=116>Robert</entity> . <entity id=117>Eddard</entity> and <entity id=118>Robert greet</entity> each other warmly , and then <entity id=119>Robert</entity> demands to see the crypts and pay his respects to <entity id=117>Eddard</entity> 's deceased sister , <entity id=120>Lyanna</entity> , much to <entity id=121>Queen Cersei</entity> 's impatience . After <entity id=122>Robert</entity> and <entity id=123>Eddard</entity> depart , <entity id=124>Cersei</entity> sends <entity id=125>Jaime</entity> to find their younger brother <entity id=126>Tyrion</entity> , who is a dwarf . `` The Imp '' has found his way to the brothel in the town outside <entity id=127>Winterfell</entity> , where he enjoys the attentions of a prostitute named <entity id=128>Ros</entity> . <entity id=129>Jaime</entity> tells <entity id=130>Tyrion</entity> , a man of limited height but with immense appetites , that he will be needed at the feast that night . <entity id=131>Jaime</entity> has hired three more prostitutes for <entity id=132>Tyrion</entity> , to hurry things along . <entity id=133>Lyanna</entity> 's statue in the crypts of <entity id=134>Winterfell</entity> . In the crypts <entity id=135>Robert</entity> offers up his prayers at the tomb of <entity id=136>Lyanna Stark</entity> , <entity id=137>Eddard</entity> 's younger sister , whom <entity id=135>Robert</entity> was betrothed to before she was kidnapped by <entity id=138>Prince Rhaegar Targaryen</entity> and died shortly after being rescued . He tells <entity id=139>Eddard</entity> that in his dreams he kills <entity id=140>Rhaegar</entity> every night anew . <entity id=141>Eddard</entity> reminds him that <entity id=142>House Targaryen</entity> was destroyed , but <entity id=143>Robert</entity> replies : `` not all of them . `` . <entity id=144>Robert</entity> formally offers <entity id=145>Eddard</entity> the role of <entity id=146>Hand</entity> , and <entity id=145>Eddard</entity> asks for time to consider . <entity id=147>Robert</entity> agrees , but offers a sweetener : the hand of his son , <entity id=148>Joffrey</entity> , in marriage to <entity id=149>Eddard</entity> 's daughter , <entity id=150>Sansa</entity> . A great feast is held and <entity id=151>Cersei</entity> and <entity id=152>Catelyn</entity> exchange cordial words . <entity id=153>Cersei</entity> seems more impressed by <entity id=154>Sansa</entity> , thinking that she will be a great hit at court . Outside the feast , <entity id=155>Jon Snow</entity> works at his sword practice , angry that <entity id=156>Catelyn</entity> thought it would be inappropriate that a bastard should attend . His uncle <entity id=157>Benjen Stark</entity> , <entity id=158>First Ranger</entity> of the <entity id=159>Night's Watch</entity> , arrives to join the feast , and <entity id=160>Jon</entity> asks him to take him back to the <entity id=161>Wall</entity> with him . <entity id=162>Benjen</entity> agrees to consider it . <entity id=163>Tyrion Lannister</entity> then arrives and talks to <entity id=164>Jon</entity> , suggesting that he is too pricklish and quick to take offense when his illegitimacy is pointed out . He should take the insult and wear it like armor , so that no one can hurt him with it . When <entity id=165>Jon</entity> angrily asks Tyrion what he knows about it , <entity id=166>Tyrion</entity> replies that `` all dwarfs are bastards in their father 's eyes . `` . <entity id=167>Eddard</entity> and <entity id=168>Catelyn</entity> receive a letter in the night , delivered to <entity id=169>Maester Luwin</entity> by a messenger from the <entity id=170>Eyrie</entity> . The letter is from <entity id=171>Catelyn</entity> 's sister , <entity id=172>Lady Lysa Arryn</entity> , the widow of <entity id=173>Jon Arryn</entity> . In the letter , <entity id=174>Lysa</entity> says that <entity id=175>Jon Arryn</entity> was murdered by the <entity id=176>Lannisters</entity> and that they plan to conspire against King <entity id=177>Robert</entity> . <entity id=178>Luwin</entity> counsels that <entity id=179>Eddard</entity> should accept <entity id=180>Robert</entity> 's offer to be <entity id=181>Hand</entity> , so he can investigate the truth of the matter and protect the King . <entity id=182>Eddard</entity> , while he would prefer to stay at <entity id=183>Winterfell</entity> , agrees with <entity id=184>Luwin</entity> and accepts the offer . The next morning <entity id=185>Eddard</entity> and <entity id=186>Robert</entity> go hunting , leaving the castle largely empty . <entity id=187>Bran</entity> indulges in some climbing but , while climbing a broken tower , he hears someone moaning . He peers through a window and finds the queen and her brother engaged in a sexual act . <entity id=188>Cersei</entity> spots him and warns <entity id=189>Jaime</entity> , who grabs <entity id=190>Bran</entity> . <entity id=191>Jaime</entity> looks out the window to make sure nobody else is watching and only sees Summer . He turns to <entity id=192>Bran</entity> and asks how old he is . When <entity id=193>Bran</entity> replies `` ten , '' Jaime remarks with a sigh , `` The things I do for love . '' With that , he pushes <entity id=194>Bran</entity> out of the window . Across the <entity id=195>Narrow Sea</entity> . In the <entity id=196>Free City</entity> of <entity id=197>Pentos</entity> , across the <entity id=198>Narrow Sea</entity> , <entity id=199>Viserys</entity> and <entity id=200>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> enjoy the hospitality of <entity id=201>Magister Illyrio Mopatis</entity> . <entity id=202>Viserys</entity> has arranged to wed his sister <entity id=203>Daenerys</entity> ( also called `` Dany '' ) to <entity id=204>Khal Drogo</entity> , the warlord of a Dothraki khalasar of forty thousand warriors . In return , <entity id=205>Drogo</entity> will give Viserys the army he needs to reclaim the <entity id=206>Iron Throne</entity> . <entity id=207>Viserys</entity> prepares <entity id=208>Daenerys</entity> for meeting the <entity id=209>Khal</entity> . He tells her what a beautiful young woman she has turned into , and slips off her dress and fondles her breast . She is silent and looks away as if pretending it is n't happening . She steps into a hot bath that has just been poured . This greatly distresses her maid who believes the water will scald her . However , <entity id=210>Daenerys</entity> seems not to notice it and appears to be unharmed . <entity id=211>Drogo</entity> arrives in <entity id=212>Pentos</entity> and approves of <entity id=213>Daenerys</entity> . <entity id=214>Illyrio</entity> and <entity id=215>Viserys</entity> discuss the quest to sail back to <entity id=216>Westoros</entity> , and <entity id=215>Viserys</entity> inquirers when the wedding will take place . <entity id=217>Daenerys</entity> is not pleased with the arrangement and blurts out that she does not want to marry <entity id=218>Drogo</entity> . <entity id=219>Viserys</entity> insists that she will , because in return <entity id=220>Drogo</entity> will give him the army he needs to retake their father 's throne from <entity id=221>Robert Baratheon</entity> . <entity id=222>Viserys</entity> adds that he would let her be raped by all forty thousand of <entity id=223>Drogo</entity> 's men and their horses if it meant getting his throne back . A short time later , <entity id=224>Drogo</entity> arrives at <entity id=225>Illyrio</entity> 's estate . After taking a glance at <entity id=226>Daenerys</entity> , <entity id=227>Drogo</entity> rides away without having to dismount from his horse . <entity id=228>Viserys</entity> is concerned , but <entity id=229>Illyrio</entity> assures him that , if he did not approve of <entity id=230>Daenerys</entity> , they would have known . <entity id=231>Daenerys</entity> in her wedding dress . Later , <entity id=232>Daenerys</entity> marries <entity id=233>Khal Drogo</entity> and a great celebration is held . Several people die in impromptu duels , which <entity id=234>Illyrio</entity> says is a good sign : a Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair . The bride and groom receive many gifts , but for <entity id=235>Dany</entity> , two are particularly interesting . The first is a box containing three beautiful stones . According to <entity id=236>Illyrio</entity> , these are dragon eggs from the <entity id=237>Shadow Lands</entity> beyond <entity id=238>Asshai</entity> that have turned to stone with the passing of time . <entity id=239>Dany</entity> appears to feel some connection with the eggs , but brushes it off for the time being . The second is a selection of books containing stories and songs from the <entity id=240>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , given by <entity id=241>Ser Jorah Mormont</entity> , an exiled knight of <entity id=242>House Mormont</entity> . <entity id=243>Ser Ser</entity> swears fealty to <entity id=244>Viserys</entity> as King and offers him his support and advice , which is accepted . For his gift , <entity id=245>Drogo</entity> gives Daenerys a beautiful white stallion . <entity id=246>Viserys</entity> asks his sister to make <entity id=247>Drogo</entity> happy . <entity id=248>Drogo</entity> and <entity id=249>Daenerys</entity> ride down to the shore and consummate their marriage on the beach at sunset . <entity id=250>Daenerys</entity> is visibly upset and terrified .
