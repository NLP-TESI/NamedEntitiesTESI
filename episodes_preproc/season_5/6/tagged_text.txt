<entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> trains . <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> and Tyrion run into slavers . <entity class="NE" id=10470>Trystane</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10471>Myrcella</entity> make plans . <entity class="NE" id=10472>Jaime</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10473>Bronn</entity> reach their destination . The <entity class="NE" id=10474>Sand Snakes</entity> attack . In <entity class="NE" id=10475>Braavos</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> continues her training with the <entity class="NE" id=10477>Faceless Men</entity> . She cleans a corpse methodically , which is then taken away by two men . <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> is obviously curious about what is on the other side of the door through which the corpse was taken . <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> is about to walk through the door when the <entity class="NE" id=10480>Waif</entity> obstructs her path and latches the door . <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> wants to know what happens to the bodies she scrubs clean , but the <entity class="NE" id=10480>Waif</entity> tells her that she will know when the time is right . Frustrated at the lack of answers , <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> demands to play the game of faces . The <entity class="NE" id=10480>Waif</entity> tells her that <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> has already tried playing the game but failed . She again asks <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> who she is , to which <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> replies that she is no one . The <entity class="NE" id=10480>Waif</entity> simply tells <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> to get back to work and is about to walk away when <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> asks her who she is . The <entity class="NE" id=10480>Waif</entity> tells Arya a story about how she was the only daughter of a widowed Lord , who remarried , producing another daughter . Her stepmother , in order to secure her own daughter’s future , tried to poison her . The <entity class="NE" id=10480>Waif</entity> found out about this and sought out the help of the <entity class="NE" id=10477>Faceless Men</entity> to exact her revenge . The <entity class="NE" id=10480>Waif</entity> then asks <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> whether she believed the story , surprising Arya . When <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> doesn’t respond , embarrassed that she bought the Waif’s story , the <entity class="NE" id=10480>Waif</entity> tells her to get back to work , hinting to <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> that to pass the game of faces , <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> must be able to lie convincingly . Later , when <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> is asleep , <entity class="NE" id=10497>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> comes to test <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> again . This time , when he asks Arya who she is , <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> tells him how she came to join the <entity class="NE" id=10477>Faceless Men</entity> , trying to slip in a few lies into the story . However , <entity class="NE" id=10500>Jaqen</entity> is able to tell when <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> is lying and hits her with a switch whenever she does . He strikes her repeatedly when she insists she hated the <entity class="NE" id=10502>Hound</entity> . Before he leaves , he tells her that she is lying not only to him , but to herself as well . <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=10504>Hall</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=10505>Faces</entity> . A grieving father brings his sickly daughter to the House of <entity class="NE" id=10506>Black</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10507>White</entity> . He explains to Arya that he has been to every healer in <entity class="NE" id=10475>Braavos</entity> and spent every penny he had . He tells her that his daughter is suffering and needs to find peace . <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> sits besides the girl and tells her a short false story , about how she was sick too , but her father brought her here and when she drank from the temple 's well , she was healed . This persuades the sickly girl to drink the poisoned water from the well . The water gives the peace of death to the sickly girl , and <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> , having successfully proven that she can lie , is brought to the <entity class="NE" id=10504>Hall</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=10505>Faces</entity> with <entity class="NE" id=10497>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> , a great underground chamber that houses thousands of faces . All the faces had been taken from the corpses that the acolytes wash in the temple . The <entity class="NE" id=10514>Faceless Man</entity> then asks <entity class="NE" id=10468>Arya</entity> if she is ready to give up who she is to become `` no one '' . After a moment of silence , he then states that she is not ready to become `` no one '' ( she is too attached to her past as a Stark ) , but that she is ready to become `` someone else '' . In <entity class="NE" id=10516>Slaver</entity> 's Bay . <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> in <entity class="NE" id=10516>Slaver</entity> 's Bay . On the western side of <entity class="NE" id=10516>Slaver</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=10521>Bay</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=10522>Tyrion Lannister</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10523>Jorah Mormont</entity> are still making their way to <entity class="NE" id=10524>Meereen</entity> ( on the far opposite eastern side of the region ) on foot , after losing their boat passing through the <entity class="NE" id=10525>Smoking Sea</entity> and the ruins of <entity class="NE" id=10526>Old Valyria</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> is annoyed that they did n't find any villages to steal a boat or supplies from as <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> had hoped , so they 're slowly walking and only have berries and roots to eat . The topic of just why <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> was even in <entity class="NE" id=10530>Volantis</entity> comes up , and <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> is surprised that <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> did not ask earlier : he explains that he actually fled from <entity class="NE" id=10532>Westeros</entity> because he killed his own father <entity class="NE" id=10533>Tywin</entity> . He says he did it because his father tried to have him executed for a crime he did n't commit , and then he found his father screwing the woman he loved - <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> nods , as this seems as likely a motivation for Kinslaying as any . <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> then says that despite how miserable <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> is now , at least he can say that he had a good father . <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> asks how he could have known his father <entity class="NE" id=10538>Jeor Mormont</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> explains he visited the <entity class="NE" id=10540>Wall</entity> once and met him : he was a great leader who seemed to genuinely care about all of his men , a rare thing in the world , but now as the eulogy for <entity class="NE" id=10541>Night's Watch</entity> members goes , `` the world will not see his like again . '' <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> is shocked to realize he means that his father is dead . <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> becomes apologetic and says he thought that <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> knew already . <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> asks how he died : Tyrion says he only knows the report he heard , which said that his father led an expedition beyond the <entity class="NE" id=10540>Wall</entity> , but there was a mutiny , and <entity class="NE" id=10547>Jeor</entity> was murdered by his own men . <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> processes this in silent grief , then changes the subject by saying that they have to keep moving . As they walk , <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> asks why <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> would support <entity class="NE" id=10551>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> and how she would be better than any other rulers , or why <entity class="NE" id=10532>Westeros</entity> would even support her , given that her father was the <entity class="NE" id=10553>Mad King</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> explains that he never used to believe in things like destiny and was very cynical , but after seeing <entity class="NE" id=10555>Daenerys</entity> emerge from the flames unharmed with baby dragons , he believes in her now , and the <entity class="NE" id=10556>Iron Throne</entity> is hers by right . <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> remains skeptical that this does n't automatically mean she will be a good queen , given that the <entity class="NE" id=10558>Targaryens</entity> were famous for going insane , just like <entity class="NE" id=10555>Daenerys</entity> 's own father . Spotting a slaver ship in the distance , <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> pulls <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> to the ground . However , the pair has already been spotted before they start hiding , and the slavers emerge from the trees behind them and take them captive . The lead slaver , <entity class="NE" id=10562>Malko</entity> , intends to return them back to their destination in <entity class="NE" id=10530>Volantis</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> , however , manages to successfully persuade him that <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> is one of the most skilled knights in <entity class="NE" id=10532>Westeros</entity> , and would fetch a better price being sold to the fighting pits in <entity class="NE" id=10524>Meereen</entity> , which have just reopened . Though not in the circumstances they hoped , <entity class="NE" id=10518>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10469>Jorah</entity> are once again quickly heading towards <entity class="NE" id=10524>Meereen</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10571>Queen Daenerys</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=10572>Dorne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10473>Bronn</entity> and Jaime approach the <entity class="NE" id=10574>Water Gardens</entity> , wearing <entity class="NE" id=10575>Martell</entity> disguises from the soldiers they killed . <entity class="NE" id=10473>Bronn</entity> wonders what <entity class="NE" id=10472>Jaime</entity> will do once they get inside and find <entity class="NE" id=10471>Myrcella</entity> , to which <entity class="NE" id=10472>Jaime</entity> replies that he likes to improvise ; <entity class="NE" id=10473>Bronn</entity> sarcastically remarks `` That explains the golden hand . '' Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=10579>Ellaria Sand</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=10474>Sand Snakes</entity> are already inside the <entity class="NE" id=10581>Gardens</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10582>Ellaria</entity> sends them out to abduct <entity class="NE" id=10471>Myrcella</entity> , telling them to do it `` for <entity class="NE" id=10584>Oberyn</entity> . `` . Myrcella herself is enjoying another stroll with her betrothed , <entity class="NE" id=10585>Trystane Martell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=10470>Trystane</entity> 's father Prince <entity class="NE" id=10587>Doran Martell</entity> and his bodyguard <entity class="NE" id=10588>Areo Hotah</entity> watch from above . <entity class="NE" id=10589>Doran</entity> comments that they look lovely together , but that they do n't realize how dangerous their betrothal is , and that he and <entity class="NE" id=10590>Areo</entity> must protect them . <entity class="NE" id=10589>Doran</entity> asks if <entity class="NE" id=10590>Areo</entity> remembers how to uses his longaxe , and <entity class="NE" id=10590>Areo</entity> assures him that he does . <entity class="NE" id=10471>Myrcella</entity> and her intended <entity class="NE" id=10594>Trystane Martell Jaime</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10473>Bronn</entity> infiltrate the <entity class="NE" id=10574>Water Gardens</entity> and soon come upon <entity class="NE" id=10471>Myrcella</entity> kissing <entity class="NE" id=10470>Trystane</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10472>Jaime</entity> tries to convince <entity class="NE" id=10471>Myrcella</entity> to come with him , but <entity class="NE" id=10470>Trystane</entity> interferes , suspicious of the bloodstains on <entity class="NE" id=10473>Bronn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10472>Jaime</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=10602>Dornish</entity> robes . When <entity class="NE" id=10470>Trystane</entity> tries to draw his sword , <entity class="NE" id=10473>Bronn</entity> quickly knocks him down , to <entity class="NE" id=10471>Myrcella</entity> 's horror . <entity class="NE" id=10472>Jaime</entity> tries to lead her away , but they are suddenly attacked by the <entity class="NE" id=10474>Sand Snakes</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10473>Bronn</entity> fights against <entity class="NE" id=10609>Tyene</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10610>Nymeria</entity> , while <entity class="NE" id=10611>Obara</entity> attacks Jaime with her spear , driving him away from <entity class="NE" id=10471>Myrcella</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10611>Obara</entity> orders Nym to break away from <entity class="NE" id=10473>Bronn</entity> and take <entity class="NE" id=10471>Myrcella</entity> prisoner , but as <entity class="NE" id=10616>Nym</entity> tries to pull her away , they are cut off by <entity class="NE" id=10590>Areo</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10618>Prince Doran</entity> 's guards , who surround them and force them all to drop their weapons . <entity class="NE" id=10472>Jaime</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=10473>Bronn</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=10582>Ellaria</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=10474>Sand Snakes</entity> are all taken into custody . In <entity class="NE" id=10623>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=10624>Petyr Petyr</entity> arrives in King’s Landing and is on his way to meet <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> when he is confronted by <entity class="NE" id=10626>Brother Lancel</entity> and some other Sparrows . <entity class="NE" id=10627>Lancel</entity> warns <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> that they have purged <entity class="NE" id=10623>King</entity> 's Landing of its corrupt ways , and the new King’s Landing will not tolerate his prostitution business . <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> dismisses these threats . <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> , meeting with <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> , continues to deny her involvement in <entity class="NE" id=10633>Loras Tyrell’s</entity> arrest by the <entity class="NE" id=10634>Faith Militant</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> is not fooled and warns that <entity class="HSE" id=10636>House Tyrell</entity> will not tolerate this insult . <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> claims that she is the insulted one since <entity class="NE" id=10638>Ser Loras</entity> , who was promised to her , prefers the company of men . <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> then explains why she summoned <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> ; she is suspicious where his loyalties truly lie and asks him whether she can rely on the the <entity class="NE" id=10641>Vale</entity> to fight for the Throne if the time comes . <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> assures her that young <entity class="NE" id=10643>Robin</entity> heeds his advice and he will always counsel loyalty to the Throne . <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> then reveals that <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> is back in <entity class="NE" id=10646>Winterfell</entity> , where <entity class="NE" id=10647>Roose Bolton</entity> has arranged for her to marry <entity class="NE" id=10648>Ramsay</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> is infuriated by the Boltons’ betrayal . To add fuel to the fire , <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> adds that marrying the last remaining <entity class="NE" id=10651>Stark</entity> gives the Boltons a stronger hold over the <entity class="NE" id=10652>North</entity> than an alliance with a hated southern house . <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> counsels patience and suggests letting the <entity class="NE" id=10654>Boltons</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10655>Stannis</entity> fight each other , and when the victor is still recovering from the battle , step in and defeat him . He suggests that Cersei’s uncle <entity class="NE" id=10656>Kevan Lannister</entity> muster a force or have Jaime Lannister lead an army to the <entity class="NE" id=10652>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> contemptuously claims that her uncle doesn’t have the courage to lead an army , while <entity class="NE" id=10472>Jaime</entity> is away on a “sensitive diplomatic mission.” <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> proposes that the soldiers of the <entity class="NE" id=10641>Vale</entity> could fight instead but <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> is unsure of Baelish’s ability to lead an army . <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> convinces her , stating that he `` lives to serve '' . All <entity class="NE" id=10628>Baelish</entity> wants in return is to be named <entity class="NE" id=10664>Warden</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=10652>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> agrees to talk to the King about this . <entity class="NE" id=10667>Olenna Olenna</entity> returns to King’s Landing after learning of her grandson’s arrest . <entity class="NE" id=10668>Olenna</entity> tries to talks <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> into releasing <entity class="NE" id=10670>Loras</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> sticks to her claim that it was the <entity class="NE" id=10634>Faith Militant</entity> who arrested <entity class="NE" id=10670>Loras</entity> and she had nothing to do with it . <entity class="NE" id=10668>Olenna</entity> warns <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> that her actions have endangered the Lannister-Tyrell alliance – the very alliance that is supplying the capital with food . <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> informs <entity class="NE" id=10668>Olenna</entity> that the <entity class="NE" id=10678>High Septon</entity> has called for a preliminary hearing to determine whether the charges against <entity class="NE" id=10670>Loras</entity> have merit and expresses confidence that <entity class="NE" id=10670>Loras</entity> will be acquitted . <entity class="NE" id=10680>Margaery</entity> is arrested . The <entity class="NE" id=10681>High Sparrow</entity> interrogates <entity class="NE" id=10670>Loras</entity> first , who refutes the accusations against him . He then questions <entity class="NE" id=10680>Margaery</entity> , who also denies any knowledge of it . The <entity class="NE" id=10681>High Sparrow</entity> then calls in <entity class="NE" id=10685>Olyvar</entity> , in character as Loras’s `` squire '' , who claims that the accusations against <entity class="NE" id=10670>Loras</entity> are in fact true . <entity class="NE" id=10685>Olyvar</entity> also admits that <entity class="NE" id=10680>Margaery</entity> walked in on them once , but didn’t seem surprised . To support his testimony , <entity class="NE" id=10685>Olyvar</entity> tells the <entity class="NE" id=10681>High Sparrow</entity> of a birthmark <entity class="NE" id=10670>Loras</entity> has that is shaped like <entity class="NE" id=10572>Dorne</entity> , much to <entity class="NE" id=10670>Loras</entity> ' shock and fury . Deciding that this is more than enough evidence for a trial , the <entity class="NE" id=10681>High Sparrow</entity> has Loras arrested . Since <entity class="NE" id=10680>Margaery</entity> bore false witness before the <entity class="NE" id=10695>Gods</entity> , she is arrested too . As <entity class="NE" id=10680>Margaery</entity> is forcefully dragged away , she calls out for <entity class="NE" id=10697>Tommen</entity> , paralyzed with indecision , while <entity class="NE" id=10668>Olenna</entity> sadly regards <entity class="NE" id=10625>Cersei</entity> 's barely contained smug expression . In the <entity class="NE" id=10652>North</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=10646>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> is joined by <entity class="NE" id=10703>Myranda</entity> in her room . She offers to help <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> take a bath , so she is presentable to <entity class="NE" id=10648>Ramsay</entity> during the wedding . While she is washing <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> 's back , <entity class="NE" id=10703>Myranda</entity> mentions three other girls whom <entity class="NE" id=10648>Ramsay</entity> had been with , and how he ultimately victimized them after a while because they bored him . Knowing that Myranda is trying to frighten her , <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> startles <entity class="NE" id=10703>Myranda</entity> by revealing that she knows about her relationship with <entity class="NE" id=10648>Ramsay</entity> . She coolly tells <entity class="NE" id=10703>Myranda</entity> that she is a Stark of <entity class="NE" id=10646>Winterfell</entity> and will not be intimidated by the likes of her , and dismisses her to finish her bath herself , though she is visibly shaken by <entity class="NE" id=10703>Myranda</entity> 's story . <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> is wed. Later , when <entity class="NE" id=10715>Reek</entity> comes to fetch <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> for the wedding , she refuses to hold Reek’s arm , even after he pleads with her to do so , saying that <entity class="NE" id=10648>Ramsay</entity> will punish him if she doesn’t . <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> coldly asks if he thinks she cares what <entity class="NE" id=10648>Ramsay</entity> does to him , and strides past him . Then , in front of the <entity class="NE" id=10719>Godswood</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=10715>Reek</entity> gives <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> away to <entity class="NE" id=10648>Ramsay</entity> ( who actually allows <entity class="NE" id=10715>Reek</entity> to call himself Theon Greyjoy ) during the wedding ceremony , which is officiated by <entity class="NE" id=10647>Roose Bolton</entity> and attended by many <entity class="NE" id=10724>Northern Lords</entity> . After retreating to the bedroom , <entity class="NE" id=10648>Ramsay</entity> orders <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> to take her clothes off . <entity class="NE" id=10715>Reek</entity> is about to leave but <entity class="NE" id=10648>Ramsay</entity> tells him he must stay . <entity class="NE" id=10648>Ramsay</entity> quips to Reek , `` You grew up with her as a girl , now watch her become a woman . '' Annoyed by <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> 's hesitance , he angrily rips open the back of her dress and pushes her face-down over the side of the bed . As he unbuckles his clothes , <entity class="NE" id=10645>Sansa</entity> obediently remains still but begins crying softly . <entity class="NE" id=10715>Reek</entity> is visibly distraught and begins silently crying himself , as <entity class="NE" id=10648>Ramsay</entity> proceeds to rape her , and forcefully consummate their marriage .
