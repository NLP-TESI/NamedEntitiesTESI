<entity class="NE" id=11201>Stannis</entity> confronts a troubling decision . <entity class="NE" id=11202>Jon</entity> returns to the <entity class="NE" id=11203>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11204>Mace</entity> visits the <entity class="NE" id=11205>Iron Bank</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11206>Arya</entity> encounters someone from her past . <entity class="NE" id=11207>Dany</entity> reluctantly oversees a traditional celebration of athleticism . At the <entity class="NE" id=11208>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11209>Jon</entity> watches wildlings enter inside <entity class="NE" id=11210>Castle Black</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11211>Jon Jon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11212>Tormund</entity> , and the surviving few thousand wildlings from <entity class="NE" id=11213>Hardhome</entity> arrive at the <entity class="NE" id=11214>Wall</entity> , before the gates of <entity class="NE" id=11215>Castle Black</entity> . For a tense moment <entity class="NE" id=11216>Ser Alliser Thorne</entity> hesitates to let all of their old enemies through , but finally he gives the order to open the gate . Thousands of wildlings come through the <entity class="NE" id=11217>Wall</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=11218>Castle Black</entity> itself , including many women and children , and even the giant <entity class="NE" id=11219>Wun Wun</entity> . Many men of the <entity class="NE" id=11220>Night's Watch</entity> glare at them . <entity class="NE" id=11221>Alliser</entity> coolly says to Jon that he has a good heart ( to save so many people ) , but that it may end up getting them all killed . <entity class="NE" id=11222>Jon</entity> reunites with <entity class="NE" id=11223>Samwell Tarly</entity> , but is despondent , saying that the mission was a disaster and they only managed to save a small fraction of the wildlings at <entity class="NE" id=11224>Hardhome</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11225>Sam</entity> points to different wildlings passing by and notes that each of them would have died if he had done nothing at all , so it was n't a complete failure . In the <entity class="NE" id=11226>North</entity> . During the night at <entity class="NE" id=11227>Stannis Baratheon</entity> 's army camp , <entity class="NE" id=11228>Melisandre</entity> gazes intently into the flames of her tent 's brazier hoping to receive visions from the <entity class="NE" id=11229>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=11230>Light</entity> . In the distance , several tents burst into flames , sending confused men shouting , and one horse screams as he runs away on fire . During the night , <entity class="NE" id=11231>Ramsay Bolton</entity> and twenty men raided the camp , burning much of their food supplies and heavy siege weapons . Hundreds of horses also died in the fire . <entity class="NE" id=11232>Davos</entity> notes that their situation is now dire : they do n't have enough food to make the march back to <entity class="NE" id=11233>Castle Black</entity> or to advance to <entity class="NE" id=11234>Winterfell</entity> , and without their siege weapons they have little chance of storming the castle to take its food supplies anyway . <entity class="NE" id=11235>Stannis</entity> asks how this could happen and <entity class="NE" id=11236>Davos</entity> insists that the <entity class="NE" id=11237>Boltons</entity> know the <entity class="NE" id=11238>North</entity> 's terrain better than they do so it was easy for a raiding party to sneak into camp . <entity class="NE" id=11239>Stannis</entity> suggests that the watchmen were either collaborating with the enemy or simply not attentive enough at their posts to allow such a disaster - either way he orders them to be executed . <entity class="NE" id=11240>Stannis</entity> says to slaughter the dead horses for their meat , which should at least buy them a little time . <entity class="NE" id=11241>Stannis</entity> 's demeanor becomes grave and half-stunned , as he believes there is only one course of action to take . He starts by ordering <entity class="NE" id=11242>Davos</entity> to return to <entity class="NE" id=11243>Castle Black</entity> to ask for more supplies from <entity class="NE" id=11244>Jon Snow</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11245>Davos</entity> is confused given that even if <entity class="NE" id=11246>Jon</entity> did decide to resupply them the provisions probably would n't reach them in time , and wonders why <entity class="NE" id=11247>Stannis</entity> would send him instead of just a messenger . <entity class="NE" id=11248>Stannis</entity> insists that it is because he needs his Hand of the King to engage in diplomacy to win <entity class="NE" id=11249>Jon</entity> over - but in reality , <entity class="NE" id=11248>Stannis</entity> sends <entity class="NE" id=11250>Davos</entity> away so he would n't be around to stop what <entity class="NE" id=11248>Stannis</entity> was planning on doing next . <entity class="NE" id=11251>Davos</entity> visits the tent of <entity class="NE" id=11252>Stannis</entity> 's daughter <entity class="NE" id=11253>Shireen Baratheon</entity> to say goodbye . She is enjoying reading a book by <entity class="NE" id=11254>Grand Maester Munkun</entity> about the <entity class="NE" id=11255>Dance</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=11256>Dragons</entity> , a major civil war in the history of the <entity class="NE" id=11257>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . They share a laugh about how a knight tried to kill the dragon Vhagar by sneaking up on it with a mirrored shield , but it did n't fool the dragon , who promptly roasted the knight . <entity class="NE" id=11258>Davos</entity> gives her a wooden stag figurine he has been carving as a present . She asks why he has been so nice to her , and he explains that he felt bad that his son <entity class="NE" id=11259>Matthos</entity> always insisted that his father learn to read and he never did . <entity class="NE" id=11260>Matthos</entity> died in the war , and by teaching <entity class="NE" id=11261>Davos</entity> to read <entity class="NE" id=11262>Shireen</entity> helped him fulfill his son 's wish . Some time after <entity class="NE" id=11263>Davos</entity> leaves , <entity class="NE" id=11264>Stannis</entity> himself visits <entity class="NE" id=11265>Shireen</entity> , visibly shaken but trying to speak to her kindly . He asks about her reading , and she explains that `` The <entity class="NE" id=11266>Dance</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=11267>Dragons</entity> '' was a great civil war between <entity class="NE" id=11268>Rhaenyra Targaryen</entity> and her half-brother <entity class="NE" id=11269>Aegon</entity> , each of whom thought they deserved to sit on the <entity class="NE" id=11270>Iron Throne</entity> . The great lords of the <entity class="NE" id=11271>Seven Kingdoms</entity> each declared for one or the other , dividing the realm in half , and tearing <entity class="NE" id=11272>Westeros</entity> apart . <entity class="NE" id=11273>Brother</entity> fought brother and dragon fought dragon in the devastating war . It was a disaster for <entity class="HSE" id=11274>House Targaryen</entity> as well , who never truly recovered . <entity class="NE" id=11275>Stannis</entity> asks who she would have chosen , <entity class="NE" id=11276>Rhaenyra</entity> or <entity class="NE" id=11277>Aegon</entity> , and she says she would n't have chosen either - it was all of the choosing sides that plunged <entity class="NE" id=11278>Westeros</entity> into civil war . <entity class="NE" id=11279>Stannis</entity> gravely responds that sometimes the world forces a man to choose even if he does n't want to , but if he stays true to himself he knows what he must do , and then it is n't really a choice at all - even if he hates doing it . <entity class="NE" id=11280>Shireen</entity> says it 's all right and she wants to help him , though he responds that she does n't even know what he wants . She does n't care and asks if there is any way she can help , and he says that there is . <entity class="NE" id=11281>Shireen</entity> insists that she wants to , because she is <entity class="NE" id=11282>Princess Shireen</entity> of <entity class="HSE" id=11283>House Baratheon</entity> , his daughter . They hug and he embraces her tightly and <entity class="NE" id=11284>Stannis</entity> whispers `` forgive me '' . Later , <entity class="NE" id=11285>Shireen</entity> exits her tent as well and sees all of the soldiers gathered around , and asks where her father is . Coming to the front of the assembly , she sees <entity class="NE" id=11286>Melisandre</entity> in front of a wooden pyre with a large stake in the middle . She starts shouting to see her father , but is grabbed by soldiers who drag her to the pyre and tie her to the stake . <entity class="NE" id=11287>Melisandre</entity> soothingly tries to calm her by saying that it will all be over soon . <entity class="NE" id=11288>Shireen</entity> 's cries ring out through the camp , but no one intervenes . <entity class="NE" id=11289>Stannis</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11290>Shireen</entity> 's mother <entity class="NE" id=11291>Selyse</entity> then appear in the crowd . <entity class="NE" id=11292>Shireen</entity> sees them and begs her mother and father to help , but they do nothing . <entity class="NE" id=11293>Selyse</entity> insists aloud to herself that the sacrifice is what the <entity class="NE" id=11294>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=11295>Light</entity> wants . <entity class="NE" id=11296>Stannis</entity> watches as <entity class="NE" id=11297>Shireen</entity> is sacrificed . <entity class="NE" id=11298>Melisandre</entity> begins praying and announces that they offer up the life of this girl to the <entity class="NE" id=11299>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=11300>Light</entity> , and sets the pyre on fire . As she explained to <entity class="NE" id=11301>Stannis</entity> before , she believes that sacrificing <entity class="NE" id=11302>Shireen</entity> 's life - which contains the power of a king 's blood - will gain the <entity class="NE" id=11303>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=11304>Light</entity> 's favor , who in return will aid them in their time of need by lifting the blizzard . <entity class="NE" id=11305>Stannis</entity> believes that if they do nothing , they will remain snowbound and all starve to death here . <entity class="NE" id=11306>Shireen</entity> continues to repeatedly cry `` Mother , please ! '' and `` Father , please ! '' - eventually even <entity class="NE" id=11307>Selyse</entity> , who only had a cold and non-existent relationship with her daughter , suddenly breaks and rushes forward , begging that they ca n't go through with it . Soldiers restrain her , however , and she sinks to the ground crying in despair . <entity class="NE" id=11308>Shireen</entity> 's cries become even more frightened , but <entity class="NE" id=11309>Stannis</entity> continues to watch even as <entity class="NE" id=11310>Selyse</entity> sobs on the ground . As the flames begin to consume Shireen she wordlessly screams in pain and fear , and eventually even <entity class="NE" id=11311>Stannis</entity> can not bear to look anymore as she burns to death . In <entity class="NE" id=11312>Dorne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11313>Jaime</entity> sits and speaks with <entity class="NE" id=11314>Doran</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11315>Jaime Lannister</entity> is escorted into the main apartments of the <entity class="NE" id=11316>Water Gardens</entity> by <entity class="NE" id=11317>Areo Hotah</entity> , to be received by <entity class="NE" id=11318>Prince Doran Martell</entity> in a luxurious solar , along with <entity class="NE" id=11319>Ellaria Sand</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11320>Doran</entity> 's son <entity class="NE" id=11321>Trystane Martell</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=11322>Jaime</entity> 's `` niece '' <entity class="NE" id=11323>Myrcella Baratheon</entity> . They lounge on a circle of couches , <entity class="NE" id=11324>Myrcella</entity> cuddling with <entity class="NE" id=11325>Trystane</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11326>Jaime</entity> notes that <entity class="NE" id=11327>Myrcella</entity> is wearing a revealing Dornish-style dress now , and she says that the warm climate of <entity class="NE" id=11328>Dorne</entity> agrees with her . Coming to the point , <entity class="NE" id=11329>Doran</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=11330>Jaime</entity> why he has snuck in to <entity class="NE" id=11331>Dorne</entity> to abduct <entity class="NE" id=11332>Myrcella</entity> back to <entity class="NE" id=11333>King</entity> 's Landing . He says he feared for her safety , but when <entity class="NE" id=11334>Doran</entity> insists why he did n't just send a letter by messenger-raven , he explains that they received a threatening message : <entity class="NE" id=11335>Myrcella</entity> 's Lannister lion pendant jammed in the mouth of dead viper . <entity class="NE" id=11336>Doran</entity> glares at <entity class="NE" id=11337>Ellaria</entity> , while a confused <entity class="NE" id=11338>Myrcella</entity> explains that her pendant was simply stolen from her room . <entity class="NE" id=11339>Jaime</entity> asks if <entity class="NE" id=11340>Doran</entity> intends to behead him , but ( acting more sympathetic now that <entity class="NE" id=11339>Jaime</entity> revealed he was threatened first ) he says that he will not , because he wishes to avoid war . He has seen what war can do , bodies piled on the battlefield and orphans left starving in cities at home , and he will not lead his people into that . <entity class="NE" id=11341>Ellaria</entity> bluntly asks what he will do , break bread with the <entity class="NE" id=11342>Lannisters</entity> ? However he says that is precisely what he will do , as wine is poured for <entity class="NE" id=11343>Jaime</entity> , and he raises his own goblet and offers a toast to King Tommen , First of His Name , long may he reign . <entity class="NE" id=11344>Jaime</entity> returns the toast but <entity class="NE" id=11345>Ellaria</entity> deliberately pours out her wine onto the floor in disgust . <entity class="NE" id=11346>Doran</entity> asks if <entity class="NE" id=11347>Tommen</entity> indeed commands that his sister be returned to the capital , and <entity class="NE" id=11348>Jaime</entity> politely says he does , to which <entity class="NE" id=11346>Doran</entity> says he can not disobey his king - <entity class="NE" id=11349>Myrcella</entity> will return to <entity class="NE" id=11350>King</entity> 's Landing . She is upset for a moment , but then <entity class="NE" id=11351>Doran</entity> explains his solution : his son <entity class="NE" id=11352>Trystane</entity> will go along with them , to take over the seat on the <entity class="NE" id=11353>Small Council</entity> which <entity class="NE" id=11354>Tywin</entity> granted to <entity class="NE" id=11355>Oberyn</entity> , but which was vacated by his death . <entity class="NE" id=11356>Doran</entity> insists that for the alliance between the <entity class="NE" id=11357>Iron Throne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11358>Dorne</entity> to continue , the engagement of <entity class="NE" id=11359>Trystane</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11360>Myrcella</entity> must stand , and <entity class="NE" id=11359>Trystane</entity> will simply take his uncle <entity class="NE" id=11361>Oberyn</entity> 's place on the <entity class="NE" id=11362>Small Council</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11363>Jaime</entity> finds <entity class="NE" id=11364>Doran</entity> 's request entirely reasonable , and <entity class="NE" id=11365>Myrcella</entity> is ecstatic that she will not be separated from <entity class="NE" id=11366>Trystane</entity> , so Jaime agrees . <entity class="NE" id=11367>Ellaria</entity> gets up to leave and snaps that it is no wonder that <entity class="NE" id=11368>Doran</entity> can not stand , because he has no spine . As she walks out he grabs her by the arm and lowers his voice , saying that she is the mother of four of his nieces and for their sake he hopes she has a long and happy life but if she talks to him that way again , she will not . Jaime then asks what fate will befall <entity class="NE" id=11369>Bronn</entity> , who is still imprisoned . <entity class="NE" id=11370>Bronn</entity> punched out <entity class="NE" id=11371>Trystane</entity> when they tried to take <entity class="NE" id=11372>Myrcella</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=11373>Jaime</entity> is asked what the normal punishment is for striking a prince where he is from . Jaime politely insists that <entity class="NE" id=11374>Bronn</entity> was only following orders and they ca n't punish him for simply following <entity class="NE" id=11375>Jaime</entity> 's commands . <entity class="NE" id=11376>Trystane</entity> agrees , saying he has learned the value of mercy from his father , but that he has one `` condition '' . In the prison cells , <entity class="NE" id=11377>Nymeria</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11378>Tyene Sand</entity> spar out of boredom , as <entity class="NE" id=11379>Obara</entity> tries to ignore them and get some sleep . The guards arrive and release <entity class="NE" id=11380>Bronn</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=11381>Tyene</entity> mocks him as he leaves . <entity class="NE" id=11382>Areo</entity> leads <entity class="NE" id=11383>Bronn</entity> back to the solar where <entity class="NE" id=11384>Doran</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11385>Jaime</entity> , and the rest remain . <entity class="NE" id=11386>Bronn</entity> apologizes to Trystane when he sees him and says he did n't mean anything by hitting him before . Jaime then gladly informs <entity class="NE" id=11387>Bronn</entity> that the <entity class="NE" id=11388>Martells</entity> agreed to let <entity class="NE" id=11387>Bronn</entity> go with <entity class="NE" id=11389>Jaime</entity> , but on one condition : wordlessly , <entity class="NE" id=11390>Areo</entity> then delivers it by striking <entity class="NE" id=11387>Bronn</entity> in the face with his elbow , the large guard captain hitting him so hard that he is knocked to the floor . Thus his debt to <entity class="NE" id=11391>Trystane</entity> is settled . Later , in the courtyard , <entity class="NE" id=11392>Areo</entity> brings <entity class="NE" id=11393>Ellaria</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=11394>Sand Snakes</entity> before <entity class="NE" id=11395>Prince Doran</entity> in his wheelchair . <entity class="NE" id=11396>Doran</entity> gives <entity class="NE" id=11397>Ellaria</entity> an ultimatum : she can either choose to swear allegiance to him ( and that she will not try something like this again ) , or she can choose death . Restraining tears , she kneels and kisses his hand . <entity class="NE" id=11398>Doran</entity> says that he believes in second chances and she is forgiven - but sternly warns her that he does not believe in third chances . <entity class="NE" id=11399>Ellaria</entity> then finds Jaime in a study writing a letter back to <entity class="NE" id=11400>King</entity> 's Landing informing of his return . He writes very poorly , given that he is using his non-dominant left hand , and <entity class="NE" id=11401>Ellaria</entity> remarks that he writes like a seven year old . <entity class="NE" id=11402>Ellaria</entity> notes how odd it is that she and <entity class="NE" id=11403>Oberyn</entity> were looked down on for their sexuality in <entity class="NE" id=11404>King</entity> 's Landing , and <entity class="NE" id=11405>Jaime</entity> is scorned for his incestuous love for <entity class="NE" id=11406>Cersei</entity> - to which he remains silent and gives no acknowledgement - though a hundred years ago , if his name were <entity class="NE" id=11407>Targaryen</entity> , no one would have blinked an eye at such a relationship . <entity class="NE" id=11408>Cryptically</entity> ( perhaps spurred by <entity class="NE" id=11409>Doran</entity> ) , she then says that she knows `` your daughter '' <entity class="NE" id=11410>Myrcella</entity> had no part in what befell <entity class="NE" id=11411>Oberyn</entity> , and maybe even <entity class="NE" id=11412>Jaime</entity> is innocent of that ( and indeed he is , as <entity class="NE" id=11411>Oberyn</entity> volunteered for the trial by combat ) . She exits , and <entity class="NE" id=11413>Jaime</entity> is left to ponder what seems to be her apology . In <entity class="NE" id=11414>Braavos</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11415>Arya</entity> , or `` <entity class="NE" id=11416>Lanna</entity> '' , sells oysters , clams , and cockles on the canal streets . <entity class="NE" id=11417>Arya</entity> , in her `` <entity class="NE" id=11418>Lanna</entity> '' persona , is once again pushing her cart through the canal streets of <entity class="NE" id=11419>Braavos</entity> selling oysters , clams , and cockles . She passes the `` Thin man '' who sells insurance to sailors , having been given a mission by the <entity class="NE" id=11420>Faceless Men</entity> to assassinate him with poisoned oysters . Just as she reaches him , however , she stops in her tracks and stares fixedly on a boat at the dock which has caught her full attention . Stepping out of the boat is <entity class="NE" id=11421>Master</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=11422>Coin Mace Tyrell</entity> - and the commander of his guards is none other than <entity class="NE" id=11423>Ser Meryn Trant</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=11424>Kingsguard</entity> , one of the names on <entity class="NE" id=11425>Arya</entity> 's kill list which she recites as a daily prayer . <entity class="NE" id=11426>Meryn</entity> helped betray her father and killed her Water Dancing trainer <entity class="NE" id=11427>Syrio Forel</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11428>Mace</entity> was sent by <entity class="NE" id=11429>Cersei Lannister</entity> to treat with the <entity class="NE" id=11430>Iron Bank</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=11431>Braavos</entity> , which has started calling in the crown 's massive debts , and at least try to gain a little more time to deal with the problem from the bankers . <entity class="NE" id=11432>Mace</entity> is greeted at the dock by the bank 's representative , <entity class="NE" id=11433>Tycho Nestoris</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11434>Mace</entity> addresses <entity class="NE" id=11435>Tycho</entity> politely and amiably , though he does n't realize that his jokes are n't really funny . All the while <entity class="NE" id=11436>Arya</entity> remains frozen and staring at <entity class="NE" id=11437>Ser Meryn</entity> , ignoring the thin man 's requests for some of her oysters . <entity class="NE" id=11438>Arya</entity> abandons her mission to assassinate the <entity class="NE" id=11439>Thin Man</entity> , and instead follows <entity class="NE" id=11440>Ser Meryn</entity> as he accompanies <entity class="NE" id=11441>Mace</entity> . After visiting the <entity class="NE" id=11442>Iron Bank</entity> building , <entity class="NE" id=11443>Meryn</entity> and a few other Lannister guards depart from <entity class="NE" id=11444>Mace</entity> at night and go to visit a local brothel . <entity class="NE" id=11445>Arya</entity> sneaks into the brothel under the guise of simply selling her oysters and clams from a hand basket . The bouncer <entity class="NE" id=11446>Brusco</entity> does n't want her in at first but the prostitute <entity class="NE" id=11447>Lhara</entity> , who is one of <entity class="NE" id=11448>Arya</entity> 's regular customers , tells him to let her stay , as oysters are held to be an aphrodisiac . <entity class="NE" id=11449>Arya</entity> sells a few and then makes her way to the back chambers where she spies on Meryn from behind some shutters . <entity class="NE" id=11450>Meryn</entity> catches a brief look at her at one point , and she seems vaguely familiar , but he just shrugs it off ( it has been years since he last saw her , she is older and thus looks different , she has different Braavosi-style hair and clothes , and he does n't think that <entity class="NE" id=11451>Arya</entity> would logically be in <entity class="NE" id=11452>Braavos</entity> ) . The brothel 's madam presents several girls in succession to <entity class="NE" id=11453>Meryn</entity> , but he passes on each as too old . She brings out her best and most expensive prostitute , a beautiful young woman named <entity class="NE" id=11454>Anara</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=11455>Meryn</entity> again dismisses her as too old . The madam slowly realizes that <entity class="NE" id=11456>Meryn</entity> is perversely interested in young girls who are barely teenagers - around <entity class="NE" id=11457>Arya</entity> 's age - so she brings out a very young girl who <entity class="NE" id=11456>Meryn</entity> accepts gruffly , bluntly saying he expects another `` fresh '' one tomorrow . After he leaves the madam runs into <entity class="NE" id=11458>Arya</entity> and shoos her out . Later , <entity class="NE" id=11459>Arya</entity> returns to the House of <entity class="NE" id=11460>Black</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11461>White</entity> empty-handed , having abandoned her first mission for the <entity class="NE" id=11462>Faceless Men</entity> . When <entity class="NE" id=11463>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> asks what happened , she lies to him and says that the <entity class="NE" id=11464>Thin Man</entity> simply was n't hungry today and did n't order any of her oysters . <entity class="NE" id=11465>Jaqen</entity> quips that perhaps this is why he is a `` thin man '' , and <entity class="NE" id=11466>Arya</entity> promises that she will follow through on the assassination tomorrow . She departs , and while <entity class="NE" id=11467>Jaqen</entity> seems to suspect that she was lying , he makes no outward reaction to it . In <entity class="NE" id=11468>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11469>Dany</entity> claps to start the fights . Attended by <entity class="NE" id=11470>Tyrion Lannister</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11471>Missandei</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=11472>Daario Naharis</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11473>Daenerys</entity> sits in the royal box at the <entity class="NE" id=11474>Daznak</entity> 's Pit . <entity class="NE" id=11475>Hizdahr zo Loraq</entity> arrives late , claiming to have been putting the final touches on the arrangements for the event . When the first two combatants take the field , <entity class="NE" id=11476>Hizdahr</entity> indicates that <entity class="NE" id=11477>Daenerys</entity> is to start the fight with a clap of her hands . <entity class="NE" id=11478>Daario</entity> verbally spars with <entity class="NE" id=11479>Hizdahr</entity> for much of the first match , drawing <entity class="NE" id=11480>Daenerys</entity> 's attention from the spectacle in front of her . Her attention returns to the arena when <entity class="NE" id=11481>Jorah Mormont</entity> gives the traditional dedication to her . In spite of <entity class="NE" id=11482>Jorah</entity> 's previous successes , he has decidedly mixed results in the grand melee he finds himself in . The grand melee begins with six fighters , with <entity class="NE" id=11483>Jorah</entity> pairing up against a <entity class="NE" id=11484>Norvosi</entity> long-axe fighter . The <entity class="NE" id=11485>Norvosi</entity> is able to land several blows against <entity class="NE" id=11486>Jorah</entity> , eventually knocking him to the ground , however <entity class="NE" id=11486>Jorah</entity> is able to bring out his dagger and eventually bury it into the <entity class="NE" id=11485>Norvosi</entity> 's chest after a brief melee . <entity class="NE" id=11487>Dany</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11488>Missandei</entity> during the riots . Meanwhile , a <entity class="NE" id=11489>Braavosi Water Dancer</entity> easily dispatches his Dothraki opponent , and then focuses his attention on <entity class="NE" id=11490>Jorah</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11491>Jorah</entity> finds himself hopelessly outmatched by the <entity class="NE" id=11492>Water Dancer</entity> and suffers many cuts from his opponent 's rapier . During the fight , a Meerenese Pit Fighter is able to lance his opponent in the chest . The <entity class="NE" id=11493>Water Dancer</entity> eventually knocks <entity class="NE" id=11494>Jorah</entity> to the ground , and is about to deliver a killing blow , but fails to notice the pit fighter who kills him from behind . <entity class="NE" id=11495>Jorah</entity> then battles the pit fighter and kills him and is the last fighter standing . At this moment <entity class="NE" id=11496>Jorah</entity> suddenly grabs and hurls a spear at the royal box – embedding itself in a Son of the <entity class="NE" id=11497>Harpy</entity> sneaking up behind <entity class="NE" id=11498>Daario</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=11499>Sons</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=11500>Harpy</entity> reveal themselves on every level of the arena and begin slaughtering collaborating <entity class="NE" id=11501>Masters</entity> and freedmen alike – <entity class="NE" id=11502>Hizdahr</entity> included . <entity class="NE" id=11503>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11504>Daario</entity> evacuate <entity class="NE" id=11505>Daenerys</entity> from the royal box , while <entity class="NE" id=11506>Tyrion</entity> rescues <entity class="NE" id=11507>Missandei</entity> . Finding the exits blocked , the group makes a stand in the center of the Pit with remainder of the <entity class="NE" id=11508>Unsullied</entity> defenders . Seeing they are hopelessly outnumbered , <entity class="NE" id=11509>Daenerys</entity> takes <entity class="NE" id=11510>Missandei</entity> 's hand and closes her eyes , ready to face her death . <entity class="NE" id=11511>Dany</entity> climbs on , and rides <entity class="NE" id=11512>Drogon</entity> . At that moment , a draconic screech pierces the air , and <entity class="NE" id=11513>Drogon</entity> descends upon the arena , flying out of a giant flame burst . Many of the <entity class="NE" id=11514>Sons</entity> scatter in terror as <entity class="NE" id=11515>Drogon</entity> bites , crushes and mercilessly burns the nearest ones to death . The <entity class="NE" id=11516>Sons</entity> rally enough to attack <entity class="NE" id=11517>Drogon</entity> with spears , which <entity class="NE" id=11518>Daenerys</entity> hastily makes an effort to remove . Trying to get <entity class="NE" id=11519>Drogon</entity> out of the <entity class="NE" id=11520>Sons</entity> ' range , <entity class="NE" id=11521>Daenerys</entity> climbs atop his back and bids him to fly ( `` Valahd '' ) , becoming the first Targaryen dragonrider in over a century . The <entity class="NE" id=11522>Sons</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=11523>Harpy</entity> routed for now , <entity class="NE" id=11524>Daario</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11525>Jorah</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11526>Missandei</entity> and Tyrion look on in astonishment as <entity class="NE" id=11527>Drogon</entity> soars away .
