<entity class="NE" id=10991>Arya</entity> makes progress in her training . <entity class="NE" id=10992>Sansa</entity> confronts an old friend . <entity class="NE" id=10993>Cersei</entity> struggles . <entity class="NE" id=10994>Jon</entity> travels . He convinces the wildlings to fight with the <entity class="NE" id=10995>Night</entity> 's Watch but the <entity class="NE" id=10996>White</entity> Walkers surprise them . Summary . In <entity class="NE" id=10997>Meereen</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=10998>Throne Room</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=10999>Daenerys</entity> ponders on what to do with <entity class="NE" id=11000>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11001>Jorah</entity> . She asks Tyrion why she should n't kill him , since the Lannisters are enemies to her House . He claims to have killed both of his parents and by that he is an enemy to the <entity class="NE" id=11002>Lannisters</entity> as well . <entity class="NE" id=11003>Daenerys</entity> is n't convinced that killing one 's own familiy is a good reputation for someone in her service . <entity class="NE" id=11004>Tyrion</entity> counters by wondering aloud if she at least is worth his service . Ordered to tell her why he has come to her from the other end of the world , he explains how he learned about her own story from rumours and from <entity class="NE" id=11005>Varys</entity> . He says that she – a lost girl born in a storm , who with virtually no assistance managed to acquire a barbarian horde , an effective army , conquer three cities , break the slave trade and hatch three dragons – might be worth living for when he lost everything he had lived for until then . He adds that <entity class="NE" id=11006>Daenerys</entity> needs his advice despite having a powerful army and large dragons , as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of <entity class="NE" id=11007>Westeros</entity> . She eventually agrees to spare his life , but asks what to do about <entity class="NE" id=11008>Ser Jorah</entity> . She seems poised to fulfil her promise of killing him if she saw him again , as it would not do at all for a queen not to keep her word . <entity class="NE" id=11009>Tyrion</entity> defends <entity class="NE" id=11010>Jorah</entity> , commenting that he is clearly devoted to her and quite possibly in love with her , but also that he did not trust her enough to inform her of his mission to spy on her for King <entity class="NE" id=11011>Robert</entity> and that therefore he can not be trusted to stand by her side . But , he argues , just as a queen should keep true to her oaths , she should also not kill those devoted to her . <entity class="NE" id=11012>Daenerys</entity> exiles <entity class="NE" id=11013>Jorah</entity> from the city . Contemplating his greyscale , <entity class="NE" id=11014>Jorah</entity> returns to Yezzan zo <entity class="NE" id=11015>Qaggaz</entity> and offers to fight for him . He promises to lead <entity class="NE" id=11016>Yezzan</entity> 's team to the <entity class="NE" id=11017>Great Pit</entity> and win the tournament for the <entity class="NE" id=11018>Queen –</entity> after that Yezzan can make a fortune selling <entity class="NE" id=11019>Jorah</entity> on the black market . Later , <entity class="NE" id=11020>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11021>Daenerys</entity> sit in her solar and have a talk about ambitions . When <entity class="NE" id=11022>Tyrion</entity> mentions what a horrible father <entity class="NE" id=11023>Tywin</entity> was , <entity class="NE" id=11024>Daenerys</entity> admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father . <entity class="NE" id=11025>Daenerys</entity> is curious about the circumstances of <entity class="NE" id=11026>Tyrion</entity> 's murder of <entity class="NE" id=11027>Tywin</entity> . He wryly promises that if she decides not to kill him then one day he will tell her , but on that day they will need a lot more wine than the large decanter they are drinking from . They discuss the role of <entity class="NE" id=11028>Varys</entity> in their stories and <entity class="NE" id=11029>Tyrion</entity> assures Daenerys he trusts him , and that he 's probably the reason she was n't killed years ago . <entity class="NE" id=11030>Tyrion</entity> was convinced by <entity class="NE" id=11031>Varys</entity> that she could be a ruler who deserves his support . When <entity class="NE" id=11032>Daenerys</entity> asks how he can get her what she wants , <entity class="NE" id=11033>Tyrion</entity> nearly rolls his eyes at her desire for the <entity class="NE" id=11034>Iron Throne</entity> . He suggests that she might want to stay in <entity class="NE" id=11035>Slaver</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=11036>Bay</entity> and build a new kingdom for herself in <entity class="NE" id=11037>Meereen</entity> , complimenting her on reopening the fighting pits and her upcoming political marriage . She assures him that she will stay and help stabilize things , and make sure the slave trade stays broken , but <entity class="NE" id=11038>Essos</entity> is not her `` home . '' <entity class="NE" id=11039>Tyrion</entity> counters that no one will support her in <entity class="NE" id=11040>Westeros</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=11041>Daenerys</entity> somewhat idealistically declares that the common people will support her . <entity class="NE" id=11042>Tyrion</entity> generously assumes that this will happen ( which it generally does n't ) , but then he reminds Daenerys that <entity class="NE" id=11043>Meereen</entity> has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the <entity class="NE" id=11044>Great Masters</entity> and the smallfolk , and extends this to <entity class="NE" id=11045>Westeros</entity> and its <entity class="NE" id=11046>Great Houses</entity> . He notes that <entity class="NE" id=11047>Houses Targaryen</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11048>Stark</entity> are effectively dead due to the combined actions of their `` two terrible fathers . '' Neither <entity class="HSE" id=11049>House Lannister</entity> nor <entity class="HSE" id=11050>House Baratheon</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=11051>Dragonstone</entity> will ever support her claim in light of their histories with the <entity class="NE" id=11052>Targaryens</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11053>Tyrion</entity> says that leaves <entity class="HSE" id=11054>House Tyrell</entity> who might be willing to switch sides due to <entity class="NE" id=11055>Cersei</entity> 's recent schemes against them but that still is n't enough . <entity class="NE" id=11056>Daenerys</entity> stubbornly likens the <entity class="NE" id=11057>Great Houses</entity> , including her own <entity class="HSE" id=11058>House Targaryen</entity> , to the spokes on a wheel , one on top and then others , and on and on , crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy . <entity class="NE" id=11059>Tyrion</entity> sarcastically warns that others have dreamed of stopping the wheel , but <entity class="NE" id=11060>Daenerys</entity> clarifies that she plans to break it . <entity class="NE" id=11061>Daenerys</entity> decides <entity class="NE" id=11062>Tyrion</entity> will remain as her advisor , but confiscates the wine , as a drunk is of no use to her . In <entity class="NE" id=11063>Braavos</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11064>Arya</entity> assumes the identity of <entity class="NE" id=11065>Lanna</entity> , a clam-seller , and shows <entity class="NE" id=11066>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> she can convincingly become a different person , developing an elaborate and very believable backstory . The <entity class="NE" id=11067>Faceless Man</entity> sends her , as <entity class="NE" id=11068>Lanna</entity> , to the harbor where she observes someone referred to as `` the thin man '' refuse a contract to insure a man 's boat , leaving the man in desperate circumstances . <entity class="NE" id=11069>Jaqen</entity> explains the thin man 's business is a sort of gamble yet he does not honor his agreements ; when a ship captain dies at sea , he is supposed to make good on his promise and pay the family , but he often does n't . <entity class="NE" id=11070>Jaqen</entity> instructs her to kill him , and hands her a `` gift '' for the thin man — a vial of poison . The waif is skeptical of Arya/Lanna 's success . In <entity class="NE" id=11071>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=11072>Septa Septa</entity> continues to urge an imprisoned Cersei to confess in return for her freedom . She remains defiant , despite being obliged to drink water from the floor out of sheer thirst . <entity class="NE" id=11073>Qyburn</entity> visits her in her cell , and informs her that her trial will begin soon for the crimes of fornication , treason , incest , and <entity class="NE" id=11074>Robert</entity> 's murder , all of which <entity class="NE" id=11075>Cersei</entity> furiously dismisses as `` lies . '' <entity class="NE" id=11076>Qyburn</entity> tells her that <entity class="NE" id=11077>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> has summoned <entity class="NE" id=11078>Kevan Lannister</entity> to serve as <entity class="NE" id=11079>Hand</entity> of the King . <entity class="NE" id=11080>Kevan</entity> has , at this point in time , already arrived , and he has refused to visit her in prison . <entity class="NE" id=11081>Qyburn</entity> also tells her that <entity class="NE" id=11082>Tommen</entity> has become reclusive , refusing to see anyone and refusing to eat in his emotional state . Before leaving , he tells her `` the work continues '' on their secret project . In the <entity class="NE" id=11083>North</entity> . A bitter and determined <entity class="NE" id=11084>Sansa</entity> confronts Reek about his latest betrayal . <entity class="NE" id=11085>Reek</entity> apologetically affirms he was helping her and that there is no escaping <entity class="NE" id=11086>Ramsay</entity> . He tells her that <entity class="NE" id=11087>Theon Greyjoy</entity> tried to escape but <entity class="NE" id=11088>Ramsay</entity> caught him and tortured him until there was no Theon left . <entity class="NE" id=11089>Sansa</entity> coldly expresses approval and reminds <entity class="NE" id=11090>Reek</entity> of the role he played in her family 's downfall , and that if she could do to him what <entity class="NE" id=11091>Ramsay</entity> did , she would . <entity class="NE" id=11092>Reek</entity> shamefully admits he deserved his torture as he did terrible things , specifically killing `` those boys . '' Enraged by his dismissive reference seemingly to her brothers as `` those boys '' rather than <entity class="NE" id=11093>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11094>Rickon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11095>Sansa</entity> vehemently demands to know why they should be dead while he still breathes the air , forcing <entity class="NE" id=11096>Reek</entity> to finally admit that they were not in fact <entity class="NE" id=11093>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11094>Rickon</entity> , only two farm boys . Stunned by this admission , <entity class="NE" id=11097>Sansa</entity> 's anger towards <entity class="NE" id=11098>Reek</entity> cools but when she presses him as to where they might have gone , calling him Theon again , he breaks down and runs out the room , crying , `` Not Theon ! <entity class="NE" id=11099>Reek</entity> ! `` . <entity class="NE" id=11100>Roose Roose</entity> maintains that his army must wait inside <entity class="NE" id=11101>Winterfell</entity> , thus starving out <entity class="NE" id=11102>Stannis</entity> ' forces , as <entity class="NE" id=11101>Winterfell</entity> had enough supplies to last 6 months under siege . Such conditions would cause a mutiny in the ranks of the <entity class="NE" id=11103>Baratheon</entity> force and break them down . <entity class="NE" id=11104>Ramsay</entity> , on the other hand , has a plan to defeat <entity class="NE" id=11105>Stannis</entity> decisively and asks his father to lend him `` just 20 good men . `` . At the <entity class="NE" id=11106>Wall</entity> . Gilly continues to tend <entity class="NE" id=11107>Sam</entity> 's wounds . Olly enters with some food , having heard what happened . Once <entity class="NE" id=11108>Gilly</entity> leaves , Olly expresses concern at joining forces with the wildlings , particularly <entity class="NE" id=11109>Tormund</entity> , who led the raid in which his parents were killed . <entity class="NE" id=11110>Sam</entity> reassures <entity class="NE" id=11111>Olly</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=11112>Jon</entity> knows what he is doing , and that unless he is successful , neither the <entity class="NE" id=11113>Night's Watch</entity> nor <entity class="NE" id=11114>Westeros</entity> stands a chance against the <entity class="NE" id=11115>White Walkers</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11116>Sam</entity> explains this is a hard choice <entity class="NE" id=11117>Jon</entity> had to make , however unpopular , and then tells him not to worry , as <entity class="NE" id=11117>Jon</entity> always comes back . At <entity class="NE" id=11118>Hardhome</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11119>Jon Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11120>Tormund Giantsbane</entity> , along with other members of the <entity class="NE" id=11121>Night's Watch</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=11122>Free Folk</entity> , arrive at the wildling town <entity class="NE" id=11123>Hardhome</entity> to convince the rest of the wildlings to join them in the upcoming war against the <entity class="NE" id=11124>White Walkers</entity> and their armies of Wights . Insisting on never being an ally with a <entity class="NE" id=11125>Crow</entity> , The <entity class="NE" id=11126>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=11127>Bones</entity> insults <entity class="NE" id=11128>Tormund</entity> for being at the side of an enemy like <entity class="NE" id=11129>Jon Snow</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11130>Tormund</entity> seizes the <entity class="NE" id=11131>Lord</entity> 's staff and beats his former ally to death with it . The wildling elders decide to gather in the <entity class="NE" id=11132>Townshall</entity> to hear out <entity class="NE" id=11133>Jon</entity> 's proposal ; an alliance between the <entity class="NE" id=11134>Free Folk</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=11135>Night</entity> 's Watch in the face of their common enemy , the undead . Having not seen <entity class="NE" id=11136>Mance Rayder</entity> since he was taken prisoner at <entity class="NE" id=11137>The Wall</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=11138>Wildlings</entity> question his whereabouts . <entity class="NE" id=11139>Snow</entity> reluctantly informs them that he is dead and that he shot him personally with an arrow . The group is infuriated , but as they move in to kill him , <entity class="NE" id=11140>Tormund</entity> vouches for him , describing how <entity class="NE" id=11141>Rayder</entity> was about to be burned at the stake as a warning from <entity class="NE" id=11142>Stannis Baratheon</entity> , and how <entity class="NE" id=11143>Snow</entity> defied <entity class="NE" id=11144>Stannis</entity> by ending his life quickly instead of humiliating him and making him suffer in the flames . Some leaders are convinced , such as <entity class="NE" id=11145>Karsi</entity> and the giant <entity class="NE" id=11146>Wun Wun</entity> , but others like the Thenn warrior Loboda begin to leave . <entity class="NE" id=11147>Jon</entity> offers them the dragonglass daggers , telling them that his friend had killed a <entity class="NE" id=11148>White Walker</entity> with one . The <entity class="NE" id=11149>Wildlings</entity> still seem unconvinced . While approximately five thousand <entity class="NE" id=11150>Free Folk</entity> gather to set sail to the <entity class="NE" id=11151>Wall</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=11152>Night's Watch</entity> starts gathering the dragonglass daggers in the tent . <entity class="NE" id=11153>Edd</entity> approaches <entity class="NE" id=11154>Wun Wun</entity> who holds one of the daggers , examining it curiously . The giant appears unwilling to hand it over and asks <entity class="NE" id=11155>Edd</entity> `` The fuck you looking at ? '' in the giants ' rudimentary form of the <entity class="NE" id=11156>Old Tongue</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11157>Edd</entity> walks away quietly , without collecting the arrowhead . Suddenly , dogs begin barking and the sounds of a storm are heard . Recognizing the sign of approaching <entity class="NE" id=11158>White Walkers</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11159>Loboda</entity> orders the gates of <entity class="NE" id=11160>Hardhome</entity> to be shut , abandoning many of the <entity class="NE" id=11161>Free Folk</entity> on the other side to their fate . As the storm reaches the village , the screams of the people shut outside the walls of <entity class="NE" id=11162>Hardhome</entity> quickly fall silent . A moment later , a large host of undead wights begin breaking through the gates and climbing over the walls . <entity class="NE" id=11163>Jon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11164>Tormund</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11165>Loboda</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11166>Karsi</entity> fight alongside others to give as many people as possible an opportunity to make it to their ships . <entity class="NE" id=11167>Eddison Tollett</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11168>Wun Wun</entity> , and others are trapped inside the townhall , which is set upon by wights and catches fire – in the confusion , the bag of dragonglass weapons is lost . The <entity class="NE" id=11169>Night King</entity> raises the dead wildlings into wights . On top of a hill overlooking <entity class="NE" id=11170>Hardhome</entity> , several <entity class="NE" id=11171>White Walkers</entity> mounted on undead horses observe the battle , including the <entity class="NE" id=11172>Night King</entity> . Noticing them , and realizing the need for dragonglass , <entity class="NE" id=11173>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11174>Loboda</entity> go to the burning townhall , only to be confronted by a <entity class="NE" id=11175>White Walker</entity> warrior . While <entity class="NE" id=11176>Loboda</entity> faces the threat , <entity class="NE" id=11177>Jon Snow</entity> goes for the dragonglass . <entity class="NE" id=11178>Loboda</entity> is quickly killed after his axe shatters immediately upon contacting the <entity class="NE" id=11179>White Walker</entity> 's ice blade . <entity class="NE" id=11180>Jon</entity> just manages to grab a dragonglass dagger but is tossed aside by the <entity class="NE" id=11181>White Walker</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11182>Jon</entity> retrieves <entity class="NE" id=11183>Longclaw</entity> and defends himself against the <entity class="NE" id=11184>White Walker</entity> and both combatants are astonished to see the <entity class="NE" id=11185>Valyrian</entity> steel remain intact after colliding with the <entity class="NE" id=11184>White Walker</entity> 's blade . Seizing the opportunity , <entity class="NE" id=11186>Jon</entity> strikes the <entity class="NE" id=11187>White Walker</entity> , shattering his body into fragments of ice , confirming that <entity class="NE" id=11188>Valyrian</entity> steel is just as lethal to them as dragonglass . The <entity class="NE" id=11189>Night King</entity> , watching the entire battle from a distance , seems at least mildly intrigued by this turn of events . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=11190>Karsi</entity> fights off multiple wights before being confronted by a pack of undead children . Frozen by the horror , she is unable to resist as she is mauled to death . The <entity class="NE" id=11191>White</entity> Walkers deploy another large host of wights , letting them hurl themselves over the cliffs above <entity class="NE" id=11192>Hardhome</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11193>Jon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11194>Edd</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11195>Tormund</entity> and the remaining defenders flee for their lives . Shielded by <entity class="NE" id=11196>Wun Wun</entity> , who throws several wights off himself and wields a burning log as a club before walking into the sea with them , they manage to get to the last remaining boat and quickly row out to a safe distance . As <entity class="NE" id=11197>Jon</entity> and the others look on in horror , the <entity class="NE" id=11198>Night King</entity> raises his arms triumphantly ; all around it , the slain wildlings rise up as undead wights , including <entity class="NE" id=11199>Karsi</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=11200>Night King</entity> and his army continue to stare in silence as they retreat .
