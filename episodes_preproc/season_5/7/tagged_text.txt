<entity id=10767>Jon</entity> prepares for conflict . <entity id=10768>Sansa</entity> tries to talk to Theon . <entity id=10769>Brienne</entity> waits for a sign . <entity id=10770>Stannis</entity> remains stubborn . Jaime attempts to reconnect with family . At the <entity id=10771>Wall</entity> . <entity id=10772>Jon</entity> departs for <entity id=10773>Hardhome</entity> with <entity id=10774>Tormund</entity> and a group of rangers , after speaking with <entity id=10775>Ser Alliser Thorne</entity> and <entity id=10776>Sam</entity> . Before they leave , <entity id=10777>Sam</entity> gives <entity id=10778>Jon</entity> some of his dragonglass weapons , reminding him of their use against the <entity id=10779>White Walkers</entity> . <entity id=10780>Afterward</entity> , <entity id=10781>Sam</entity> and <entity id=10782>Gilly</entity> visit <entity id=10783>Maester Aemon</entity> , who is bedridden and dying from old age . Gilly brings her baby <entity id=10784>Little Sam</entity> for him to hold and cheer him up a little . <entity id=10785>Aemon</entity> happily notes that her son has a laugh just like his little brother Egg ( King <entity id=10786>Aegon V</entity> ) had when he was a baby . In a moment of clarity , <entity id=10787>Aemon</entity> gravely warns <entity id=10788>Gilly</entity> that she and her son must leave the <entity id=10789>Wall</entity> while they still can , before winter comes ( and the <entity id=10790>White Walkers</entity> with it ) . <entity id=10791>Aemon</entity> 's condition steadily deteriorates during the night , and he fades in and out of consciousness . Near the end he wakes up delirious from a dream , still lost in memory from his youth : he calls out to his brother Egg , and says that he had a strange dream that he was an old man . <entity id=10792>Aemon</entity> passes away soon afterwards . <entity id=10793>Samwell</entity> loses his virginity with <entity id=10794>Gilly</entity> . In the courtyard of <entity id=10795>Castle Black</entity> , <entity id=10796>Sam</entity> eulogizes <entity id=10797>Aemon</entity> before lighting his funeral pyre , declaring for all to hear that he was the blood of the dragon - `` but now his watch is ended . '' <entity id=10798>Ser Alliser</entity> whispers that <entity id=10799>Sam</entity> 's friends are abandoning him one by one . <entity id=10800>Afterward</entity> , <entity id=10801>Gilly</entity> is attacked in the dining hall by two brothers , but <entity id=10802>Sam</entity> and <entity id=10803>Jon</entity> 's direwolf , <entity id=10804>Ghost</entity> , come to her rescue . <entity id=10805>Sam</entity> is badly beaten , and <entity id=10806>Gilly</entity> tends to his injuries . Still in grief at <entity id=10807>Aemon</entity> 's death and impressed by <entity id=10808>Sam</entity> defending her , <entity id=10809>Gilly</entity> climbs on top of him and they have sex . In the <entity id=10810>North</entity> . At <entity id=10811>Winterfell</entity> , <entity id=10812>Reek</entity> brings food to <entity id=10813>Sansa</entity> . She begs him for help , telling him how she has been locked in her bedchamber since her wedding and is visited by <entity id=10814>Ramsay</entity> every night and he forces himself on her . <entity id=10815>Reek</entity> simply tells her to obey <entity id=10816>Ramsay</entity> or else he would do worse things to her . <entity id=10817>Sansa</entity> asks what <entity id=10818>Ramsay</entity> did to Reek to break him to such an extent , but he ca n't bring himself to tell her . He tries to leave but <entity id=10819>Sansa</entity> grabs and reminds him that he betrayed her family , making <entity id=10820>Reek</entity> apologize profusely . <entity id=10821>Sansa</entity> informs him that her family still has allies in the <entity id=10822>North</entity> and tells him to light a candle at the top of the <entity id=10823>Broken Tower</entity> which will signal them that she is in danger . When <entity id=10824>Reek</entity> refuses to do it , <entity id=10825>Sansa</entity> reminds him of his true name , <entity id=10826>Theon Greyjoy</entity> , and makes him promise that he 'll help her . <entity id=10827>Reek</entity> hesitantly agrees . He trudges through the snow with the candle , up a flight of stairs and into Ramsayâ€™s room . Later , <entity id=10828>Sansa</entity> is taken to see <entity id=10829>Ramsay</entity> on the ramparts , which are still under construction . While he is distracted , <entity id=10830>Sansa</entity> grabs a workman 's tool lying on a nearby barrel and pockets it . <entity id=10831>Ramsay</entity> speaks of his thoughts on how they will easily defeat <entity id=10832>Stannis</entity> 's army since their soldiers , unlike <entity id=10832>Stannis</entity> 's , are trained to fight in the snow , and how he 'll one day be the <entity id=10833>Lord</entity> of <entity id=10834>Winterfell</entity> and the <entity id=10835>Warden</entity> of the <entity id=10836>North</entity> . <entity id=10837>Sansa</entity> reminds him of the unborn baby , who , if a boy , will have a stronger claim on the <entity id=10838>North</entity> since he 'll be a true-born . <entity id=10839>Ramsay</entity> tells her that he is <entity id=10840>Roose Bolton</entity> 's eldest son , legitimized by the king , who <entity id=10841>Sansa</entity> reminds him is another bastard . <entity id=10842>Ramsay</entity> is obviously angered by <entity id=10843>Sansa</entity> 's remarks , but does n't act on it , simply stating that bastards can rise in the world too , informing her of <entity id=10844>Jon</entity> 's appointment as <entity id=10845>Lord Commander</entity> of the <entity id=10846>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity id=10847>Ramsay</entity> then brings up the reason why he summoned her , and shows her the crucified and partly flayed corpse of the old woman who promised to help Sansa if she lit a candle in the <entity id=10848>Broken Tower</entity> . <entity id=10849>Ramsay</entity> then reveals to Sansa that Reek , who seems miserable to have squashed <entity id=10850>Sansa</entity> 's only hope of an escape , came to him and told him everything . <entity id=10851>Sansa</entity> chokes back tears as a gleeful Ramsay orders his men to take her back to her chamber . Meanwhile , <entity id=10852>Brienne</entity> stares intently at <entity id=10853>Winterfell</entity> castle from her room in the inn , waiting for the sign to rescue <entity id=10854>Sansa</entity> . <entity id=10855>Stannis</entity> 's troops make camp during a violent snowstorm . <entity id=10856>Davos Davos</entity> meets with <entity id=10857>Stannis</entity> and informs him that forty horses died the previous night and more will die come sunset . The Stormcrows , a sellsword company , have fled in the night . <entity id=10858>Davos</entity> thinks that they should go back to <entity id=10859>Castle Black</entity> and wait out the weather since they do not have enough food , but <entity id=10860>Stannis</entity> stubbornly tells him that they will not retreat to <entity id=10859>Castle Black</entity> because he will not risk being known as `` the King who Ran '' . As winter will soon arrive , they also run the risk of being stuck at <entity id=10861>Castle Black</entity> for years , during which the <entity id=10862>Boltons</entity> will regain their strength . Seeing no other way to convince <entity id=10863>Stannis</entity> otherwise , <entity id=10864>Davos</entity> leaves . <entity id=10865>Stannis</entity> asks <entity id=10866>Melisandre</entity> if she is sure of their victory at <entity id=10867>Winterfell</entity> . <entity id=10868>Melisandre</entity> assures him , reminding him that he also saw the vision of his victory in the flames , but <entity id=10869>Stannis</entity> is not so sure what he saw anymore . <entity id=10870>Melisandre</entity> reassures him that her visions will come true , but also states that a sacrifice , one with <entity id=10871>King</entity> 's blood , must be made in order to ensure their victory , implying that they sacrifice <entity id=10872>Shireen</entity> . <entity id=10873>Stannis</entity> is infuriated by the suggestion and orders her to leave . In <entity id=10874>Dorne</entity> . <entity id=10875>Prince Prince</entity> has <entity id=10876>Areo Hotah</entity> bring <entity id=10877>Myrcella</entity> to Jaime in the quarters where he is confined , as <entity id=10878>Jaime</entity> is concerned for her safety . Displaying a somewhat more critical mind than her brothers , <entity id=10879>Myrcella</entity> is suspicious about <entity id=10880>Jaime</entity> 's `` diplomatic mission '' to bring her back to <entity id=10881>King</entity> 's Landing , to which Jaime only replies that there are `` complicated matters '' involved . <entity id=10882>Myrcella</entity> flatly refuses to return with him , stating her intent to marry <entity id=10883>Trystane</entity> . <entity id=10884>Bronn</entity> is singing The <entity id=10885>Dornishman</entity> 's Wife in his jail cell , while in the adjoining cell , the <entity id=10886>Sand Snakes</entity> listen with a mix of annoyance from <entity id=10887>Obara</entity> and <entity id=10888>Nymeria</entity> and amusement from <entity id=10889>Tyene</entity> . After he finishes , the two parties trade barbs , and <entity id=10890>Tyene</entity> inquires about <entity id=10891>Bronn</entity> 's arm , which she cut with her daggers during their earlier fight , with <entity id=10891>Bronn</entity> brushing it off as `` a new scar '' . The two begin to talk about <entity id=10892>Tyene</entity> 's beauty , which <entity id=10893>Bronn</entity> dismisses until she begins to disrobe . <entity id=10894>Bronn</entity> stares intently , and begins to change his mind about her . <entity id=10895>Tyene</entity> once again inquires about his arm , and then his head , at which point <entity id=10896>Bronn</entity> 's nose starts bleeding and his vision blurs . <entity id=10897>Bronn</entity> collapses and tries to play off his sudden illness , but <entity id=10898>Tyene</entity> reveals that her daggers were coated with a slow-acting poison called The <entity id=10899>Long Farewell</entity> , and her attempts to seduce <entity id=10897>Bronn</entity> were to get his heart pumping faster , thereby allowing the poison to act quicker . She points to an ampoule on her necklace , which contains the antidote , but only offers to give it to <entity id=10900>Bronn</entity> on the condition that he agrees that she is the most beautiful woman in the world . Growing weaker , <entity id=10901>Bronn</entity> barely manages to reply affirmatively , and she tosses the ampoule to a relieved <entity id=10901>Bronn</entity> . <entity id=10902>Tyene</entity> smiles smugly at him and remarks that she finds him handsome as well , before re-robing and sitting down next to her mildly amused half-sisters . In <entity id=10903>King</entity> 's Landing . In the <entity id=10904>Great Sept</entity> of <entity id=10905>Baelor</entity> , <entity id=10906>Lady Olenna</entity> meets with the <entity id=10907>High Sparrow</entity> to discuss the imprisonment of her grandchildren , <entity id=10908>Ser Loras</entity> and <entity id=10909>Queen Margaery</entity> . Although they briefly bond over the infirmities of age , she demands that he release them and he declines , stating they will be punished for their crimes . The <entity id=10910>High Sparrow</entity> tells her that the <entity id=10911>Gods</entity> ' <entity id=10912>Laws</entity> must be applied to everyone equally . <entity id=10913>Olenna</entity> first tries to bribe him , but learning that he can not be bought , threatens to end the <entity id=10914>Tyrell</entity> support for the capital by ending shipments of food . Again the <entity id=10915>High Sparrow</entity> is unfazed , remarking that the nobility of <entity id=10916>Westeros</entity> have forgotten they are outnumbered by the common folk and tells <entity id=10917>Olenna</entity> to ponder what happens when the many stop fearing the few . Returning to her palanquin , <entity id=10918>Olenna</entity> receives a letter bearing <entity id=10919>Petyr Baelish</entity> 's seal . Meanwhile , in the <entity id=10920>Red Keep</entity> , King Tommen rails over his inability to help <entity id=10921>Margaery</entity> . He wants to start a war for <entity id=10922>Margaery</entity> , declaring his love for her to a dumbstruck <entity id=10923>Cersei</entity> . To maintain control of the situation , she offers to speak with the <entity id=10924>High Sparrow</entity> for him and advocate for <entity id=10925>Margaery</entity> and <entity id=10926>Loras</entity> 's release . Although clearly suspicious , the still-overwhelmed Tommen agrees . <entity id=10927>Littlefinger</entity> meets with <entity id=10928>Olenna</entity> in his ransacked brothel , where they share a tense conversation . <entity id=10929>Olenna</entity> reminds him of the role they both played in <entity id=10930>Joffrey</entity> 's murder , and that , should her House fall , she will have no reason to keep his involvement a secret . <entity id=10931>Littlefinger</entity> explains why he returned to <entity id=10932>King</entity> 's <entity id=10933>Landing</entity> - he dared not refuse <entity id=10934>Cersei</entity> 's summons , and was obliged to give her information . He tells Olenna that he will give her the same thing he gave <entity id=10935>Cersei</entity> : a handsome young man â€” implied , in this instance , to be <entity id=10936>Lancel</entity> . In the <entity id=10937>Sept</entity> 's cells , <entity id=10938>Cersei</entity> meets with <entity id=10939>Margaery</entity> and brings her food but <entity id=10939>Margaery</entity> refuses , revealing that she knows her mother-in-law is responsible for having her and <entity id=10940>Loras</entity> imprisoned . <entity id=10941>Cersei</entity> , fearful of being overheard , denies this . <entity id=10942>Margaery</entity> mocks <entity id=10943>Cersei</entity> for her unconvincing lies of trying to save her , going as far as to say that while she knows how to lie and scheme , she does n't understand innocence and decency , which <entity id=10942>Margaery</entity> suspects is why <entity id=10944>Tommen</entity> loves her , <entity id=10942>Margaery</entity> , and was willing to send <entity id=10943>Cersei</entity> back to <entity id=10945>Casterly Rock</entity> . <entity id=10946>Cersei</entity> , concealing her fury , tells <entity id=10947>Margaery</entity> her trial will soon begin and that her son needs his mother more than ever . <entity id=10948>Margaery</entity> throws the stew at <entity id=10949>Cersei</entity> , and yells at her to get out . <entity id=10950>Cersei</entity> leaves the cell , smiling smugly at <entity id=10951>Margaery</entity> . On her way out , a still gleeful Cersei meets with the <entity id=10952>High Sparrow</entity> in a chapel that predates the <entity id=10953>Great Sept</entity> . The pair briefly discuss the legal process that <entity id=10954>Margaery</entity> and <entity id=10955>Loras</entity> will face . As the conversation goes on , however , it 's clear that the <entity id=10956>High Sparrow</entity> is about to turn the tables on <entity id=10957>Cersei</entity> . When <entity id=10958>Brother Lancel</entity> appears , <entity id=10959>Cersei</entity> realizes what is about to happen , and her triumphant smile begins to crack . The <entity id=10960>High Sparrow</entity> has an irate <entity id=10961>Cersei</entity> taken into custody by a group of Septas who ignore <entity id=10961>Cersei</entity> 's threats and lock her in a cell . In <entity id=10962>Meereen</entity> . <entity id=10963>Jorah</entity> is sold by <entity id=10964>Malko</entity> to <entity id=10965>Yezzan zo Qaggaz</entity> . Before <entity id=10966>Yezzan</entity> leaves , <entity id=10967>Tyrion</entity> convinces him that <entity id=10968>Jorah</entity> and he are a team , and is also bought . In <entity id=10969>Meereen</entity> , <entity id=10970>Daenerys</entity> and <entity id=10971>Daario</entity> discuss her impending marriage to <entity id=10972>Hizdahr zo Loraq</entity> . After rejecting his suggestion that she marry him instead , <entity id=10973>Daario</entity> advises her that , on the day the fighting pits are reopened , she should gather all the <entity id=10974>Great</entity> , <entity id=10975>Wise</entity> and <entity id=10976>Good Masters</entity> and kill them . <entity id=10977>Dany</entity> is reluctant to do so , as she believes it will give her the reputation of a butcher , to which <entity id=10978>Daario</entity> replies that `` all rulers are either butchers or meat '' . <entity id=10979>Yezzan</entity> takes his fighters to <entity id=10980>Meereen</entity> , to test them in the lower pits and seek out those who are worthy to fight in the <entity id=10981>Great Pit</entity> of <entity id=10982>Daznak</entity> . They fight in front of a reluctant Daenerys , as <entity id=10983>Hizdahr</entity> has convinced her that <entity id=10984>Meereen</entity> 's ruler occasionally makes the rounds to the lower pits ahead of the main tournament . <entity id=10985>Jorah</entity> enters the Pits early , upon realizing that she is watching and will be repulsed by what she 's seeing , and elbows down Yezzan who tried to berate him . <entity id=10986>Jorah</entity> easily defeats the other fighters without killing them , impressing <entity id=10987>Dany</entity> enough to prevent her from leaving . When he reveals his identity , however , her face swiftly twists into a scowl and she orders him taken away . Before the Unsullied can comply , <entity id=10988>Jorah</entity> declares that he brought her a gift , and <entity id=10989>Tyrion</entity> enters the arena and reveals his identity to the astonished <entity id=10990>Queen</entity> .
