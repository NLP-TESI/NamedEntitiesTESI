Still grieving , <entity id=11534>Stannis</entity> prepares to march on <entity id=11535>Winterfell</entity> . However , one of his generals informs him that nearly half of his men have deserted - mainly the sellswords , who have also run away with all their horses . Another soldier comes with more bad news : <entity id=11536>Selyse</entity> has hanged herself out of grief for her daughter . As he views her body , his general reports that <entity id=11537>Melisandre</entity> has fled . <entity id=11538>Battle</entity> of <entity id=11539>Winterfell</entity> . Marching across the fields with less than half the men he once had , <entity id=11540>Stannis</entity> has his men start preparing for the siege , but is instead met in combat early by the <entity id=11541>Bolton</entity> army . The mounted <entity id=11542>Bolton</entity> army easily defeats <entity id=11543>Stannis</entity> ' tired and mountless army .

She declares who she is and that her king was killed by his brother 's shadow that bore his face , before drawing her sword to slay him . <entity id=11550>Stannis</entity> , having lost everything , simply accepts his fate to die : he tells <entity id=11551>Brienne</entity> to do her `` duty '' .

In Winterfell itself , <entity id=11558>Sansa</entity> uses a corkscrew she pocketed earlier to escape her room , and seeks out the tower to light her signal . After the candle is lit , she sees the <entity id=11559>Boltons</entity> clash with <entity id=11560>Stannis</entity> 's army and sees this as a time to slip out of <entity id=11561>Winterfell</entity> . Desperately running across the ramparts , she is caught by <entity id=11562>Myranda</entity> and <entity id=11563>Reek</entity> . <entity id=11564>Myranda</entity> threatens <entity id=11565>Sansa</entity> with a bow , however <entity id=11565>Sansa</entity> , weary and realizing she ca n't escape a shot from a bow , tells her to kill her while there is still a part of the real her left . <entity id=11566>Myranda</entity> tells <entity id=11567>Sansa</entity> that <entity id=11568>Ramsay</entity> needs her to have an heir and nothing more afterwards , but he does not need all of her in one piece to accomplish that . <entity id=11569>Sansa</entity> braces herself for the worst as <entity id=11570>Myrnada</entity> tenses her bow , but the worst does not come . for her anyway . Theon finally breaks the <entity id=11571>Bolton</entity> 's hold on him and causes <entity id=11572>Myranda</entity> to misfire , then grabs and hurls the screaming sadist over the ramparts , where she is killed instantly upon impact with the stone floor of the courtyard far below . <entity id=11573>Sansa</entity> and Theon run , but with <entity id=11574>Ramsay</entity> just returning from the battle , they find themselves with nowhere to go . Hoping to land in deep snow and survive the long fall , the two of them grasp their hands together and jump off the rampart .

However , the last girl is revealed to be <entity id=11581>Arya Stark</entity> , after removing her fake face . She pulls out a knife and stabs Meryn in both eyes and chest repeatedly , and puts a gag in his mouth to silence his cries . She then reveals her identity and reminds <entity id=11582>Meryn</entity> of how he killed her dance master , <entity id=11583>Syrio Forel</entity> , before calling him 'no one ' and slitting his throat . <entity id=11584>Arya</entity> then returns to the House of <entity id=11585>Black</entity> and <entity id=11586>White</entity> and returns the face that she used to hide her identity . However , <entity id=11587>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> and the <entity id=11588>Waif</entity> appear and say that <entity id=11589>Meryn</entity> 's life was not hers to take , and that a debt must be paid . The <entity id=11590>Waif</entity> grabs Arya as <entity id=11591>Jaqen</entity> pulls out a vial , presumably containing some kind of poison .

The three argue about <entity id=11607>Jorah</entity> 's betrayal , but they will not make any judgments without <entity id=11608>Daenerys</entity> first . The dragon was seen taking her north and that is where they need to search for their queen . <entity id=11609>Grey Worm</entity> , still recovering from his injuries , offers to go with <entity id=11610>Jorah</entity> and <entity id=11611>Daario</entity> , as does <entity id=11612>Tyrion</entity> . <entity id=11613>Daario</entity> firmly nixes both ideas : <entity id=11614>Grey Worm</entity> is needed to command the Unsullied in keeping the city under control , while <entity id=11615>Tyrion</entity> is the only one of them to have any actual political experience . He expresses confidence that with <entity id=11616>Missandei</entity> 's help , the pair of them should be able to keep <entity id=11617>Meereen</entity> under control until they return with <entity id=11618>Daenerys</entity> . As <entity id=11619>Tyrion</entity> watches <entity id=11620>Daario</entity> and <entity id=11621>Jorah</entity> depart the city , <entity id=11622>Varys</entity> calmly walks up to <entity id=11619>Tyrion</entity> .

Aboard the ship , <entity id=11646>Myrcella</entity> and Jaime talk about <entity id=11647>Cersei</entity> . <entity id=11648>Jamie</entity> begins to come clean to <entity id=11649>Myrcella</entity> , awkwardly telling her that we can not choose who we love . <entity id=11650>Myrcella</entity> then reveals that she knows that <entity id=11651>Jamie</entity> is her real father , and that she is glad that he is , and the two embrace .

She is brought outside were she has to walk naked through the streets of Kings Landing from the <entity id=11668>Great Sept</entity> of <entity id=11669>Baelor</entity> to the <entity id=11670>Red Keep</entity> as punishment . Accompanied by <entity id=11671>Septa Unella</entity> , who repeats the word `` shame '' three times and rings a bell every few steps , and six members of the <entity id=11672>Faith Militant</entity> , <entity id=11673>Cersei</entity> performs her walk of atonement amidst the leering crowds who immediately begin pelting her with filth and vicious insults , such as `` cunt '' and `` brotherfucker '' .

He hopes the <entity id=11690>White Walkers</entity> ca n't climb the <entity id=11691>Wall</entity> as there is not enough Dragonglass or <entity id=11692>Valyrian</entity> steel in <entity id=11693>Westeros</entity> to combat them . <entity id=11694>Sam</entity> asks <entity id=11695>Jon</entity> if he can travel to <entity id=11696>Oldtown</entity> to study and replace <entity id=11697>Aemon</entity> as the new Maester of the <entity id=11698>Watch</entity> .

Both of them are shocked to see a speechless and despondent Melisandre return to the <entity id=11712>Wall</entity> . <entity id=11713>Ser Ser</entity> pressures <entity id=11714>Melisandre</entity> for news , specifically asking after <entity id=11715>Shireen</entity> , but <entity id=11714>Melisandre</entity> remains silent .

He turns around to find his <entity id=11723>Brothers</entity> staring him down . <entity id=11724>Thorne</entity> makes the first move and stabs the <entity id=11725>Lord Commander</entity> . `` For the <entity id=11726>Watch</entity> '' <entity id=11727>Thorne</entity> says , as well as the others as they close in and continue stabbing him . One after another , <entity id=11728>Jon Snow</entity> is betrayed , `` For the <entity id=11729>Watch</entity> . '' Finally a tearful-eyed Olly approaches last .

The brothers leave <entity id=11732>Jon</entity> to die alone in the snow .
