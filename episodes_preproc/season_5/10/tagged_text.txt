The mounted <entity class="NE" id=11509>Bolton</entity> army easily defeats <entity class="NE" id=11510>Stannis</entity> ' tired and mountless army .

Elsewhere , <entity class="NE" id=11520>Ramsay</entity> finishes off the few remaining <entity class="NE" id=11521>Baratheon</entity> soldiers and heads back to <entity class="NE" id=11522>Winterfell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11523>Theon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11524>Sansa</entity> prepare to jump . In Winterfell itself , <entity class="NE" id=11525>Sansa</entity> uses a corkscrew she pocketed earlier to escape her room , and seeks out the tower to light her signal . After the candle is lit , she sees the <entity class="NE" id=11526>Boltons</entity> clash with <entity class="NE" id=11527>Stannis</entity> 's army and sees this as a time to slip out of <entity class="NE" id=11528>Winterfell</entity> .

Theon finally breaks the <entity class="NE" id=11538>Bolton</entity> 's hold on him and causes <entity class="NE" id=11539>Myranda</entity> to misfire , then grabs and hurls the screaming sadist over the ramparts , where she is killed instantly upon impact with the stone floor of the courtyard far below . <entity class="NE" id=11540>Sansa</entity> and Theon run , but with <entity class="NE" id=11541>Ramsay</entity> just returning from the battle , they find themselves with nowhere to go .

She pulls out a knife and stabs Meryn in both eyes and chest repeatedly , and puts a gag in his mouth to silence his cries . She then reveals her identity and reminds <entity class="NE" id=11549>Meryn</entity> of how he killed her dance master , <entity class="NE" id=11550>Syrio Forel</entity> , before calling him 'no one ' and slitting his throat . <entity class="NE" id=11551>Arya</entity> then returns to the House of <entity class="NE" id=11552>Black</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11553>White</entity> and returns the face that she used to hide her identity . However , <entity class="NE" id=11554>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=11555>Waif</entity> appear and say that <entity class="NE" id=11556>Meryn</entity> 's life was not hers to take , and that a debt must be paid . The <entity class="NE" id=11557>Waif</entity> grabs Arya as <entity class="NE" id=11558>Jaqen</entity> pulls out a vial , presumably containing some kind of poison .

With <entity class="NE" id=11570>Daenerys</entity> gone , her council is unsure on how they should continue . <entity class="NE" id=11571>Tyrion</entity> addresses both <entity class="NE" id=11572>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11573>Daario</entity> 's feelings for her , understanding all too well how one could love the wrong woman .

As <entity class="NE" id=11586>Tyrion</entity> watches <entity class="NE" id=11587>Daario</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11588>Jorah</entity> depart the city , <entity class="NE" id=11589>Varys</entity> calmly walks up to <entity class="NE" id=11586>Tyrion</entity> .
