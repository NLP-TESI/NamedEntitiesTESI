The mounted <entity class="NE" id=11542>Bolton</entity> army easily defeats <entity class="NE" id=11543>Stannis</entity> ' tired and mountless army .

After a moment 's hesitation , <entity class="NE" id=11552>Brienne</entity> swings her sword at him . Elsewhere , <entity class="NE" id=11553>Ramsay</entity> finishes off the few remaining <entity class="NE" id=11554>Baratheon</entity> soldiers and heads back to <entity class="NE" id=11555>Winterfell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11556>Theon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11557>Sansa</entity> prepare to jump . In Winterfell itself , <entity class="NE" id=11558>Sansa</entity> uses a corkscrew she pocketed earlier to escape her room , and seeks out the tower to light her signal . After the candle is lit , she sees the <entity class="NE" id=11559>Boltons</entity> clash with <entity class="NE" id=11560>Stannis</entity> 's army and sees this as a time to slip out of <entity class="NE" id=11561>Winterfell</entity> .

Theon finally breaks the <entity class="NE" id=11571>Bolton</entity> 's hold on him and causes <entity class="NE" id=11572>Myranda</entity> to misfire , then grabs and hurls the screaming sadist over the ramparts , where she is killed instantly upon impact with the stone floor of the courtyard far below . <entity class="NE" id=11573>Sansa</entity> and Theon run , but with <entity class="NE" id=11574>Ramsay</entity> just returning from the battle , they find themselves with nowhere to go .

She pulls out a knife and stabs Meryn in both eyes and chest repeatedly , and puts a gag in his mouth to silence his cries . She then reveals her identity and reminds <entity class="NE" id=11582>Meryn</entity> of how he killed her dance master , <entity class="NE" id=11583>Syrio Forel</entity> , before calling him 'no one ' and slitting his throat . <entity class="NE" id=11584>Arya</entity> then returns to the House of <entity class="NE" id=11585>Black</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11586>White</entity> and returns the face that she used to hide her identity . However , <entity class="NE" id=11587>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=11588>Waif</entity> appear and say that <entity class="NE" id=11589>Meryn</entity> 's life was not hers to take , and that a debt must be paid . The <entity class="NE" id=11590>Waif</entity> grabs Arya as <entity class="NE" id=11591>Jaqen</entity> pulls out a vial , presumably containing some kind of poison .

She then begins to lose her sight as her eyes turn white and screams for help . In <entity class="NE" id=11602>Meereen</entity> . With <entity class="NE" id=11603>Daenerys</entity> gone , her council is unsure on how they should continue . <entity class="NE" id=11604>Tyrion</entity> addresses both <entity class="NE" id=11605>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11606>Daario</entity> 's feelings for her , understanding all too well how one could love the wrong woman .

As <entity class="NE" id=11619>Tyrion</entity> watches <entity class="NE" id=11620>Daario</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11621>Jorah</entity> depart the city , <entity class="NE" id=11622>Varys</entity> calmly walks up to <entity class="NE" id=11619>Tyrion</entity> . Teasing <entity class="NE" id=11623>Tyrion</entity> about abandoning him in <entity class="NE" id=11624>Volantis</entity> , he is pleased to see <entity class="NE" id=11623>Tyrion</entity> already settling into a role that suits him .

He turns around to find his <entity class="NE" id=11723>Brothers</entity> staring him down . <entity class="NE" id=11724>Thorne</entity> makes the first move and stabs the <entity class="NE" id=11725>Lord Commander</entity> . `` For the <entity class="NE" id=11726>Watch</entity> '' <entity class="NE" id=11727>Thorne</entity> says , as well as the others as they close in and continue stabbing him .
