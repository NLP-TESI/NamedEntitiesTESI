<entity class="NE" id=9438>Arya</entity> arrives in <entity class="NE" id=9439>Braavos</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9440>Pod</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9441>Brienne</entity> run into trouble on the road . <entity class="NE" id=9442>Cersei</entity> fears for her daughter 's safety in <entity class="NE" id=9443>Dorne</entity> as <entity class="NE" id=9444>Ellaria Sand</entity> seeks revenge for <entity class="NE" id=9445>Oberyn</entity> 's death . <entity class="NE" id=9446>Stannis</entity> tempts <entity class="NE" id=9447>Jon</entity> . An adviser tempts <entity class="NE" id=9448>Dany</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=9449>Free Cities</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9450>Arya</entity> turned away from the House of <entity class="NE" id=9451>Black</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9452>White</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9453>Ternesio Ternesio</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9454>Arya Stark</entity> arrive at <entity class="NE" id=9455>Braavos</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=9456>Arya</entity> is at first scared by the horn blown by the man inside the <entity class="NE" id=9457>Titan</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=9455>Braavos</entity> . The two then arrive at the House of <entity class="NE" id=9458>Black</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9459>White</entity> on a boat . <entity class="NE" id=9460>Arya</entity> lingers outside waiting for admittance , but is rejected by an elder man despite showing the coin <entity class="NE" id=9461>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> had given her and mentioning their prior association . <entity class="NE" id=9462>Arya</entity> waits outside the House for days , endlessly reciting the names of the people she 's going to kill , but eventually tosses away her coin and wanders off into the streets of <entity class="NE" id=9463>Braavos</entity> . While hunting for pigeons , she encounters several thugs who threaten to take her food and <entity class="NE" id=9464>Needle</entity> . As she prepares to defend herself , the boys scatter when the man from the House of <entity class="NE" id=9465>Black</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9466>White</entity> appears again . After following him back to the House , <entity class="NE" id=9467>Arya</entity> demands he divulge his identity , and he returns to her the coin she threw in the water before . His face morphs into that of the man <entity class="NE" id=9468>Arya</entity> knew as <entity class="NE" id=9469>Jaqen</entity> . Stating that `` a man is not <entity class="NE" id=9470>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> , '' he responds to <entity class="NE" id=9471>Arya</entity> 's question as to who he really is with the answer `` No one . And that is what a girl must become '' as he indicates that <entity class="NE" id=9472>Arya</entity> may now enter the House . Further south , <entity class="NE" id=9473>Tyrion Lannister</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9474>Varys</entity> depart <entity class="NE" id=9475>Pentos</entity> in a large wheelhouse pulled by many horses . <entity class="NE" id=9476>Tyrion</entity> remains despondent , and as he promised , he is continuing to drink himself into a stupor . <entity class="NE" id=9477>Varys</entity> explains that they are travelling to Meereen by way of <entity class="NE" id=9478>Volantis</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9479>Varys</entity> points out that Tyrion was an effective ruler when he was acting <entity class="NE" id=9480>Hand</entity> of the King , and that each of them were outsiders due to their deformities ( a eunuch and a dwarf ) . They enjoyed accumulating power , he says , but they also wall themselves off from other people , like hiding inside of a large carriage as they are now - but deep down they were never satisfied being separate from society . <entity class="NE" id=9481>Tyrion</entity> is unmoved from his depression , and continues to insist that he 's tired of being confined in a box of some sort . <entity class="NE" id=9482>Varys</entity> again warns him that he must remain hidden and that it is unsafe to be seen publicly : <entity class="NE" id=9483>Cersei</entity> has promised a lordship to any man who brings her his head . <entity class="NE" id=9484>Tyrion</entity> scoffs and rhetorically asks if <entity class="NE" id=9485>Cersei</entity> is going to kill every dwarf in the world in the hope of eventually catching him . In <entity class="NE" id=9486>King</entity> 's Landing and the <entity class="NE" id=9487>Crownlands</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=9488>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=9489>Cersei Lannister</entity> is presented with the severed head of yet another dwarf . Her offer of a lordship for <entity class="NE" id=9490>Tyrion</entity> 's head has indeed motivated people to start killing any dwarf they can find and try to pass it off as <entity class="NE" id=9490>Tyrion</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9491>Cersei</entity> is irate , but wo n't punish the men who brought her the head for fear this will deter other such bounty hunters . She wants the head disposed of , but <entity class="NE" id=9492>Qyburn</entity> interjects and politely asks if he can keep the head , as it might be of use in some of his `` experiments . `` . <entity class="NE" id=9493>Cersei</entity> shows Jaime the `` gift '' from <entity class="NE" id=9494>Dorne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9495>Cersei</entity> summons Jaime to their late father 's office and reveals a `` gift '' from <entity class="NE" id=9496>Dorne</entity> : an ornately carved viper , with <entity class="NE" id=9497>Princess Myrcella</entity> 's unique Lannister pendant suspended from its fangs . She insists it is a threat against <entity class="NE" id=9498>Myrcella</entity> , a conclusion Jaime ca n't refute . <entity class="NE" id=9499>Cersei</entity> lashes out at <entity class="NE" id=9500>Jaime</entity> for not being a father to any of his children , to which he points out that if he had been , their children would be stoned in the streets . He declares he will fix the situation with <entity class="NE" id=9501>Myrcella</entity> and ignores <entity class="NE" id=9502>Cersei</entity> 's mocking of his one-handed status . That issue dealt with , <entity class="NE" id=9503>Cersei</entity> convenes the <entity class="NE" id=9504>Small Council</entity> . Sitting in the <entity class="NE" id=9505>Hand</entity> 's seat , she announces that `` Tommen '' has declared Qyburn the new Master of <entity class="NE" id=9506>Whisperers</entity> and that the position of <entity class="NE" id=9505>Hand</entity> of the King will remain vacant until <entity class="NE" id=9507>Tommen</entity> is old enough to decide on a candidate for himself . <entity class="NE" id=9508>Tommen</entity> has apparently also decided to make <entity class="NE" id=9509>Mace Tyrell</entity> the new Master of <entity class="NE" id=9510>Coin</entity> in addition to his duties as <entity class="NE" id=9511>Master</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=9512>Ships</entity> , and extends the ( just now made up ) position of `` Master of War '' to <entity class="NE" id=9513>Kevan Lannister</entity> . Although <entity class="NE" id=9514>Mace</entity> preens at his new responsibilities , <entity class="NE" id=9515>Pycelle</entity> is outraged at <entity class="NE" id=9516>Qyburn</entity> 's promotion ( as he was thrown out of the order of <entity class="NE" id=9517>Maesters</entity> for conducting human experimentation ) . <entity class="NE" id=9518>Kevan</entity> is disgusted at <entity class="NE" id=9519>Cersei</entity> 's blatant power play . Refusing the new position , he denounces <entity class="NE" id=9520>Cersei</entity> as nothing more than the <entity class="NE" id=9521>Queen Mother</entity> , berates her for abusing her authority to fill the <entity class="NE" id=9522>Small Council</entity> with her sycophants . He then walks out , saying he will await King <entity class="NE" id=9523>Tommen</entity> 's own instructions - at <entity class="NE" id=9524>Casterly Rock</entity> . Further north in the <entity class="NE" id=9525>Crownlands</entity> at <entity class="NE" id=9526>Castle Stokeworth</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9527>Bronn</entity> is spending time with his somewhat vapid betrothed <entity class="NE" id=9528>Lollys Stokeworth</entity> . They seem to get on relatively well , but when <entity class="NE" id=9529>Lollys</entity> reminds <entity class="NE" id=9530>Bronn</entity> that her older sister will get the castle when their mother dies , he wryly assures her that mean people like her sister usually get what 's coming to them , clearly setting his sights on the castle . <entity class="NE" id=9531>Jaime</entity> finds the couple , and reveals to Bronn that <entity class="NE" id=9532>Cersei</entity> has reneged on her deal and offered <entity class="NE" id=9533>Lollys</entity> 's hand to <entity class="NE" id=9534>Ser Willas Bracken</entity> instead . <entity class="NE" id=9535>Bronn</entity> is understandably furious about the change of arrangements until <entity class="NE" id=9536>Jaime</entity> tells him that if he helps rescue <entity class="NE" id=9537>Myrcella</entity> from <entity class="NE" id=9538>Dorne</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9535>Bronn</entity> will receive a much better girl than <entity class="NE" id=9539>Lollys</entity> , who has rights to a much better castle . In <entity class="NE" id=9540>Dorne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9541>Ellaria</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9542>Doran</entity> discuss <entity class="NE" id=9543>Oberyn</entity> 's death . In the <entity class="NE" id=9544>Water Gardens</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=9545>Dorne</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9546>Ellaria Sand</entity> rudely demands an audience with <entity class="NE" id=9547>Doran Martell</entity> , the ruling Prince of <entity class="NE" id=9545>Dorne</entity> . His bodyguard , <entity class="NE" id=9548>Areo Hotah</entity> , blocks her path , yet <entity class="NE" id=9549>Doran</entity> tells him to let her pass . She wants to take <entity class="NE" id=9550>Princess Myrcella</entity> , who at that very moment is enjoying <entity class="NE" id=9551>Trystane Martell</entity> 's company , so that she can send the princess piece by piece to <entity class="NE" id=9552>Cersei</entity> as revenge for <entity class="NE" id=9553>Oberyn Martell</entity> 's murder . <entity class="NE" id=9554>Doran</entity> refuses , reminding her that <entity class="NE" id=9555>Oberyn</entity> had participated in a trial by combat , and therefore his death was legal , and not murder . He states <entity class="NE" id=9556>Dorne</entity> will not stoop to the level of mutilating children while he rules , even if the <entity class="NE" id=9557>Sand Snakes</entity> are siding with <entity class="NE" id=9558>Ellaria</entity> . Sneering , <entity class="NE" id=9559>Ellaria</entity> asks how long he expects to rule for and storms out . <entity class="NE" id=9560>Hotah</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=9561>Prince</entity> exchange a look as she departs , the former meaningfully indicating his axe , but <entity class="NE" id=9562>Doran</entity> shakes his head and returns his attention to the <entity class="NE" id=9563>Water Gardens</entity> as he contemplates his next move . In the <entity class="NE" id=9564>Vale</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9565>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9566>Podrick</entity> arrive at an inn and dine . <entity class="NE" id=9567>Podrick</entity> spots <entity class="NE" id=9568>Sansa Stark</entity> with <entity class="NE" id=9569>Petyr Baelish</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=9570>Brienne</entity> tells him to ready the horses and she confronts them . <entity class="NE" id=9571>Brienne</entity> swears to <entity class="NE" id=9572>Sansa</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9573>Brienne</entity> mentions her sworn vow to <entity class="NE" id=9574>Sansa</entity> 's mother <entity class="NE" id=9575>Catelyn</entity> , while <entity class="NE" id=9576>Littlefinger</entity> points out how she was accused of murdering <entity class="NE" id=9577>Renly Baratheon</entity> and how both he and <entity class="NE" id=9575>Catelyn</entity> are now dead . <entity class="NE" id=9578>Sansa</entity> denies <entity class="NE" id=9579>Brienne</entity> 's request and <entity class="NE" id=9580>Littlefinger</entity> urges that she stay at the inn as the road is not safe , and seeing this as a trap , <entity class="NE" id=9579>Brienne</entity> escapes with <entity class="NE" id=9581>Podrick</entity> on the horses they take . They are chased through a forest as <entity class="NE" id=9582>Brienne</entity> fights the men and <entity class="NE" id=9583>Podrick</entity> is thrown off his horse . Reuniting , <entity class="NE" id=9584>Podrick</entity> mentions how both Stark girls denied her request for protection , but <entity class="NE" id=9585>Brienne</entity> retorts by doubting <entity class="NE" id=9586>Sansa</entity> is safe with <entity class="NE" id=9587>Littlefinger</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9588>Brienne</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=9589>Podrick</entity> to get his horse as they attempt to further pursue <entity class="NE" id=9590>Sansa</entity> and Littlefinger . In <entity class="NE" id=9591>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9592>Barristan Barristan</entity> tells Daenarys the truth about her father , the <entity class="NE" id=9593>Mad King</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9594>Daario</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9595>Grey Worm</entity> find a house belonging to a Son of the <entity class="NE" id=9596>Harpy</entity> allegedly responsible for <entity class="NE" id=9597>White Rat</entity> 's death . <entity class="NE" id=9598>Daario</entity> explains that he has been using the <entity class="NE" id=9599>Second Sons</entity> as spies throughout <entity class="NE" id=9600>Meereen</entity> , since they are far less conspicuous than <entity class="NE" id=9601>Unsullied</entity> and can indulge in the same vices as their informants ; <entity class="NE" id=9598>Daario</entity> indicates his men 's effectiveness by stabbing his dagger through a false wall , seriously injuring the man hiding behind it . Back at the <entity class="NE" id=9602>Great Pyramid</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9603>Daenerys</entity> and her council debate executing this <entity class="NE" id=9604>Harpy</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=9605>Son</entity> , but the debate devolves into a shouting match between <entity class="NE" id=9606>Mossador</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9607>Hizdahr zo Loraq</entity> . After the rest leave , <entity class="NE" id=9608>Ser Barristan</entity> tells her about her father , and confirms that , contrary to what <entity class="NE" id=9609>Viserys</entity> told her , the <entity class="NE" id=9610>Mad King</entity> was indeed quite mad , citing how his crimes against <entity class="HSE" id=9611>House Stark</entity> ultimately led to the rebellion that all but destroyed the <entity class="NE" id=9612>Targaryen</entity> dynasty . Mollified by the revelation , particularly that her crazed father always thought his atrocities were serving justice to his enemies , <entity class="NE" id=9613>Daenerys</entity> promises <entity class="NE" id=9614>Ser Barristan</entity> that there will be a trial for the accused . Before the trial begins , <entity class="NE" id=9615>Mossador</entity> kills the <entity class="NE" id=9616>Harpy</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=9617>Son</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9618>Daenerys</entity> , hoping to preserve the integrity of law , has <entity class="NE" id=9619>Mossador</entity> publicly executed , causing the freed slaves to hiss at her and throw rocks at her as she leaves , along with a riot between the former slaves and masters breaking out . Later that night , <entity class="NE" id=9620>Daenerys</entity> dismisses her council and goes outside . To her relief , <entity class="NE" id=9621>Drogon</entity> , now the size of a small house , has alighted just above her balcony . <entity class="NE" id=9622>Drogon</entity> sniffs her outstretched hand , and though he does n't attack , he flies away again , leaving his mother alone . At the <entity class="NE" id=9623>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9624>Shireen Baratheon</entity> teaches <entity class="NE" id=9625>Gilly</entity> how to read in <entity class="NE" id=9626>Castle Black</entity> 's library , apparently to <entity class="NE" id=9627>Sam</entity> 's chagrin . Gilly asks about <entity class="NE" id=9628>Shireen</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=9629>Greyscale</entity> scars , revealing that the wildlings do n't really have a word for it and that two of her sisters contracted and were driven mad by the disease , before <entity class="NE" id=9630>Craster</entity> put them out of their misery . Queen <entity class="NE" id=9631>Selyse</entity> interrupts the proceedings and dismisses <entity class="NE" id=9632>Sam</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9633>Gilly</entity> . She lectures <entity class="NE" id=9634>Shireen</entity> on the dangers of spending time with any wildlings , since they could conceivably use <entity class="NE" id=9635>Gilly</entity> to harm <entity class="NE" id=9636>Stannis</entity> through <entity class="NE" id=9634>Shireen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9637>Shireen</entity> , however , doubts that that 's how things will go . `` <entity class="NE" id=9638>Bear Island</entity> knows no king but the King in the <entity class="NE" id=9639>North</entity> , whose name is <entity class="NE" id=9640>Stark</entity> . '' - <entity class="NE" id=9641>Lyanna Mormont</entity> , ten year old Lady of <entity class="NE" id=9642>Bear Island</entity> . Stannis himself , meanwhile , discusses <entity class="NE" id=9643>Jon Snow</entity> 's recent defiance . <entity class="NE" id=9644>Stannis</entity> shows <entity class="NE" id=9645>Jon</entity> a message he received from <entity class="NE" id=9646>Lady Lyanna Mormont</entity> in response to the demand that <entity class="HSE" id=9647>House Mormont</entity> pledge itself to <entity class="NE" id=9644>Stannis</entity> ' cause . The note refuses , saying that the Mormonts know only one king , the King in the <entity class="NE" id=9648>North</entity> , and will only follow a Stark . <entity class="NE" id=9649>Jon</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=9650>Stannis</entity> that , like the <entity class="NE" id=9651>Wildlings</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=9652>Northerners</entity> will only follow one of their own . Realizing this is true , <entity class="NE" id=9653>Stannis</entity> makes <entity class="NE" id=9654>Jon</entity> an enticing offer : if he leaves the <entity class="NE" id=9655>Night's Watch</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9653>Stannis</entity> will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as <entity class="NE" id=9656>Jon Stark</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9657>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=9658>Winterfell</entity> , so he can rally the <entity class="NE" id=9659>North</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=9653>Stannis</entity> 's side and resume the fight against the <entity class="NE" id=9660>Boltons</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9661>Freys</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=9662>Lannisters</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9663>Jon</entity> is visibly moved at the prospect of having his lifelong dream finally come true , but he later admits to Sam that he plans to turn <entity class="NE" id=9664>Stannis</entity> down : he is a man of the <entity class="NE" id=9665>Night's Watch</entity> . The election for the new Lord Commander of the <entity class="NE" id=9666>Night's Watch</entity> commences , overseen by <entity class="NE" id=9667>Maester Aemon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9668>Janos Janos</entity> nominates <entity class="NE" id=9669>Alliser Thorne</entity> . Another brother names <entity class="NE" id=9670>Denys Mallister</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9671>Commander</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=9672>Shadow Tower</entity> . The vote almost begins before <entity class="NE" id=9673>Sam</entity> interrupts to put forward a third nomination : <entity class="NE" id=9674>Jon Snow</entity> . When the votes are cast , a tie is called : Snow and <entity class="NE" id=9675>Thorne</entity> have garnered an equal number of votes . With a wry smile , <entity class="NE" id=9676>Maester Aemon</entity> casts his own vote for <entity class="NE" id=9677>Jon Snow</entity> . The black brothers hail <entity class="NE" id=9678>Jon</entity> as the 998th Lord Commander of the <entity class="NE" id=9679>Night's Watch</entity> .
