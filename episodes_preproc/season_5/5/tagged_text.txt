<entity class="NE" id=10272>Dany</entity> makes a difficult decision in <entity class="NE" id=10273>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10274>Jon</entity> recruits the help of an unexpected ally . <entity class="NE" id=10275>Brienne</entity> searches for <entity class="NE" id=10276>Sansa</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10277>Theon</entity> remains under <entity class="NE" id=10278>Ramsay</entity> 's control . In <entity class="NE" id=10279>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10280>Missandei Missandei</entity> watches on as her dragons set a head of great family on fire and proceed to eat him . watches over the wounded <entity class="NE" id=10281>Grey Worm</entity> , who is still unconscious from his wounds sustained by the <entity class="NE" id=10282>Sons</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=10283>Harpy</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10284>Daenerys</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10285>Daario Naharis</entity> wake over the deceased <entity class="NE" id=10286>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10287>Hizdahr zo Loraq</entity> enters to extend his condolences . <entity class="NE" id=10288>Daario</entity> suggests pulling back around the pyramid to use it as a base from which to eradicate the <entity class="NE" id=10289>Sons</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=10290>Harpy</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10291>Daenerys</entity> instead opts for rounding up the leaders of each great family in <entity class="NE" id=10292>Meereen</entity> , including <entity class="NE" id=10293>Hizdahr</entity> . The leaders are brought to the catacombs where <entity class="NE" id=10294>Rhaegal</entity> and Viserion are chained up . <entity class="NE" id=10295>Daenerys</entity> 's Unsullied push the leaders slowly towards the two dragons , who can be heard growling from the darkness . <entity class="NE" id=10296>Daenerys</entity> states that good mothers do not give up on their children , they discipline them if needed , but never give up on them . She nods to Daario to push one of the leaders further forward . A stream of fire coming from <entity class="NE" id=10297>Rhaegal</entity> sets the man aflame before he is torn apart and eaten by both dragons . <entity class="NE" id=10298>Daenerys</entity> suggests that the dragons may determine the innocence of the captives and touches <entity class="NE" id=10299>Hizdahr</entity> 's back as if she wanted to push him but then she pretends she wants not to overfeed the dragons and lets the rest of the men be led away . <entity class="NE" id=10300>Grey Grey</entity> wakes up later with <entity class="NE" id=10301>Missandei</entity> sitting beside him . He asks if <entity class="NE" id=10302>Barristan Selmy</entity> survived the attack by the <entity class="NE" id=10303>Sons</entity> of the Harpy but <entity class="NE" id=10304>Missandei</entity> shakes her head . <entity class="NE" id=10305>Grey Grey</entity> thinks he has failed <entity class="NE" id=10306>Ser Barristan</entity> , his men and <entity class="NE" id=10307>Daenerys</entity> -- a claim <entity class="NE" id=10308>Missandei</entity> denies . <entity class="NE" id=10309>Missandei</entity> tells him he should n't be ashamed for being wounded given that he was ambushed and outnumbered , but <entity class="NE" id=10310>Grey Worm</entity> says he is ashamed that he was afraid when he was stabbed . <entity class="NE" id=10311>Missandei</entity> says that everyone fears death . However , <entity class="NE" id=10312>Grey Worm</entity> says it is n't death he fears , it is the thought of never getting to see <entity class="NE" id=10313>Missandei</entity> again that terrified him . <entity class="NE" id=10314>Missandei</entity> is noticeably touched and kisses <entity class="NE" id=10315>Grey Worm</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10316>Daenerys</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=10317>Missandei</entity> whether she should reopen the fighting pits . <entity class="NE" id=10318>Missandei</entity> only says that she has seen <entity class="NE" id=10319>Daenerys</entity> listening to her counselors when her own experience was lacking and ignoring them when she thought they were wrong . <entity class="NE" id=10320>Daenerys</entity> visits the imprisoned Hizdahr , who begs for his life . <entity class="NE" id=10321>Daenerys</entity> tells him she has decided to reopen the fighting pits , but only for free men . She also says that she will marry the head of an ancient family of <entity class="NE" id=10322>Meereen</entity> to forge a bond with the people of the city , and that she luckily has one of them on his knees already . She leaves a very confused Hizdahr to ponder that he will live , and that he will soon be <entity class="NE" id=10323>Meereen</entity> 's prince consort . At the <entity class="NE" id=10324>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10325>Maester Maester</entity> reads a note from <entity class="NE" id=10326>Slaver</entity> 's Bay to <entity class="NE" id=10327>Maester Aemon</entity> updating him on <entity class="NE" id=10328>Daenerys</entity> 's situation . <entity class="NE" id=10329>Sam</entity> praises <entity class="NE" id=10330>Daenerys</entity> 's courage but <entity class="NE" id=10331>Maester Aemon</entity> worries about his great-niece 's safety because she is all alone , under siege , and with hardly anyone to guide her , while her `` last relation '' is useless and dying thousands of miles away . <entity class="NE" id=10332>Jon Jon</entity> enters to speak with <entity class="NE" id=10333>Aemon</entity> in private . He needs the maester 's advice on a controversial order that many of the <entity class="NE" id=10334>Night's Watch</entity> will hate him for . <entity class="NE" id=10335>Aemon</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=10336>Jon</entity> that half the men at <entity class="NE" id=10337>Castle Black</entity> already hate him , but that he should trust in his command . He says that <entity class="NE" id=10338>Jon</entity> will not enjoy being <entity class="NE" id=10339>Lord Commander</entity> , but with luck , he may find the strength to do what needs to be done . <entity class="NE" id=10340>Jon</entity> is told to `` kill the boy , and let the man be born . `` . <entity class="NE" id=10341>Jon</entity> then meets with <entity class="NE" id=10342>Tormund Giantsbane</entity> and offers to forge an alliance with the wildlings , bidding <entity class="NE" id=10343>Tormund</entity> to go north of the wall and rally them all . He will open the gates for them and give them land south of the wall in which to settle . In return , the wildlings will fight alongside the Night’s Watch when <entity class="NE" id=10344>White Walkers</entity> arrive . <entity class="NE" id=10345>Tormund</entity> is initially reluctant and to convince him , <entity class="NE" id=10346>Jon</entity> unlocks his chains , freeing him . <entity class="NE" id=10347>Tormund</entity> relents , and reveals that most of the wildlings are up at <entity class="NE" id=10348>Hardhome</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10349>Jon</entity> offers him horses and men to bring the wildlings back . <entity class="NE" id=10350>Tormund</entity> tells him that they’ll need ships to bring his people back , which <entity class="NE" id=10351>Jon</entity> says he’ll borrow from <entity class="NE" id=10352>Stannis</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10353>Tormund</entity> 's final condition is that <entity class="NE" id=10354>Jon</entity> accompany him as a guarantee that the wildlings will not fall prey to any traps set by the <entity class="NE" id=10355>Night's Watch</entity> . The men of the Night’s Watch do not take news of the alliance well , citing the countless innocent lives lost due to the wildlings . Even Jon’s friend <entity class="NE" id=10356>Edd</entity> rejects this decision , stating that the wildlings killed their friends <entity class="NE" id=10357>Grenn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10358>Pyp</entity> . Nevertheless , <entity class="NE" id=10359>Jon</entity> decides to go ahead with his plan . In the library , <entity class="NE" id=10360>Sam</entity> tells Gilly about his wish to go to <entity class="NE" id=10361>Citadel</entity> and become a maester before he was sent to the Night’s Watch , when <entity class="NE" id=10362>Stannis Baratheon</entity> walks in . <entity class="NE" id=10363>Stannis</entity> reminisces about how Sam’s father , <entity class="NE" id=10364>Randyll Tarly</entity> , defeated <entity class="NE" id=10365>Robert Baratheon</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=10366>Battle</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=10367>Ashford</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10368>Stannis</entity> wants to know how <entity class="NE" id=10369>Sam</entity> killed the <entity class="NE" id=10370>White Walker</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10369>Sam</entity> tells him how he did it with a dagger made of dragonglass . <entity class="NE" id=10371>Stannis</entity> muses that it is abundantly available in <entity class="NE" id=10372>Dragonstone</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10373>Sam</entity> has been researching dragonglass and how it can kill <entity class="NE" id=10374>White Walkers</entity> , but has yet to come up with anything . <entity class="NE" id=10375>Stannis</entity> tells him to continue his research and leaves . Later , <entity class="NE" id=10376>Stannis</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=10377>Ser Davos</entity> that they will march toward Winterfell the next morning . <entity class="NE" id=10378>Davos</entity> suggests waiting until <entity class="NE" id=10379>Jon</entity> returns with the wildlings , but <entity class="NE" id=10380>Stannis</entity> decides against it , as any delay improves the <entity class="NE" id=10381>Boltons</entity> ' chances . He also wants to take <entity class="NE" id=10382>Selyse</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10383>Shireen</entity> with them , as he does not think they will be safe at the <entity class="NE" id=10384>Wall</entity> , surrounded by criminals . The next morning , Stannis’s army , with <entity class="NE" id=10385>Stannis</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10386>Melisandre</entity> at its head , starts its journey to <entity class="NE" id=10387>Winterfell</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=10388>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10389>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=10390>Tarth</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10391>Podrick Payne</entity> , still pursuing <entity class="NE" id=10392>Sansa Stark</entity> , arrive at an inn near <entity class="NE" id=10393>Winterfell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10394>Podrick</entity> thinks that <entity class="NE" id=10395>Sansa</entity> may be better off at <entity class="NE" id=10396>Winterfell</entity> now that she is far away from the <entity class="NE" id=10397>Lannisters</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=10398>Brienne</entity> believes that <entity class="NE" id=10395>Sansa</entity> will not be safe around the people who murdered her mother and brother - the <entity class="NE" id=10399>Boltons</entity> . Their conversation is interrupted by a servant . Correctly suspecting that he is still loyal to the <entity class="NE" id=10400>Starks</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=10401>Brienne</entity> tells of her allegiance to <entity class="NE" id=10402>Catelyn Stark</entity> and convinces the servant to get a message through to <entity class="NE" id=10403>Sansa –</entity> her presence still being something of a secret , the old servant seems to gain strength from the idea of a surviving <entity class="NE" id=10404>Stark</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=10405>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=10406>Ramsay Bolton</entity> and his bedwarmer <entity class="NE" id=10407>Myranda</entity> discuss Ramsay’s upcoming marriage to <entity class="NE" id=10408>Sansa</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10409>Myranda</entity> admits her jealousy of <entity class="NE" id=10410>Sansa</entity> , especially since he had promised to marry <entity class="NE" id=10409>Myranda</entity> back when he was a bastard . <entity class="NE" id=10411>Ramsay</entity> disregards Myranda’s insecurities , causing <entity class="NE" id=10412>Myranda</entity> to proclaim that perhaps she will marry too . <entity class="NE" id=10413>Ramsay</entity> is angered and violently tells her that she is his and she is not going anywhere unless she continues to bore him with her jealousy . He threateningly reminds her what he does to people who bore him , and hearing this Myranda swears never to bore him again . Meanwhile , Sansa’s maid carries a message to her . Consoling <entity class="NE" id=10414>Sansa</entity> that she still has allies in the <entity class="NE" id=10415>North</entity> , she tells <entity class="NE" id=10414>Sansa</entity> to light a candle in the highest window of the <entity class="NE" id=10416>Broken Tower</entity> if she ever needs help . As <entity class="NE" id=10417>Sansa</entity> wanders around the castle , coming to the tower where <entity class="NE" id=10418>Jaime Lannister</entity> pushed her brother <entity class="NE" id=10419>Brandon</entity> out of the window , she runs into <entity class="NE" id=10420>Myranda</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10421>Myranda</entity> puts on a friendly façade , talking to Sansa about her mother’s demise . To help <entity class="NE" id=10422>Sansa</entity> “remember” how things used to be , <entity class="NE" id=10423>Myranda</entity> leads <entity class="NE" id=10422>Sansa</entity> down to the kennels , where she finds <entity class="NE" id=10424>Reek</entity> , formerly Theon Greyjoy , asleep in one of the cages . Awoken by Sansa’s arrival , he just shakes his head , when <entity class="NE" id=10425>Sansa</entity> calls him `` Theon . '' He warns her that she should n't be down there . Seeing <entity class="NE" id=10426>Reek</entity> in such a pitiful condition , <entity class="NE" id=10427>Sansa</entity> angrily storms away . <entity class="NE" id=10428>Sansa</entity> at the `` family '' dinner . As <entity class="NE" id=10429>Reek</entity> helps <entity class="NE" id=10430>Ramsay</entity> get ready for dinner , he confesses to Ramsay that earlier that day , <entity class="NE" id=10431>Sansa</entity> saw him in his cage . <entity class="NE" id=10432>Ramsay</entity> , for his own amusement , makes it seem as though he’s going to punish <entity class="NE" id=10433>Reek</entity> severely , before simply forgiving him . At dinner , <entity class="NE" id=10434>Ramsay</entity> is initially well-behaved , toasting his wedding to <entity class="NE" id=10435>Sansa</entity> , but is soon back to his old ways as he forces <entity class="NE" id=10436>Reek</entity> to apologize to <entity class="NE" id=10435>Sansa</entity> for murdering <entity class="NE" id=10437>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10438>Rickon</entity> . With much difficulty , <entity class="NE" id=10439>Reek</entity> finally mutters an apology . <entity class="NE" id=10440>Ramsay</entity> then suggests that <entity class="NE" id=10441>Reek</entity> be the one to give <entity class="NE" id=10442>Sansa</entity> away at the wedding , since he is the closest thing <entity class="NE" id=10442>Sansa</entity> has to kin and <entity class="NE" id=10443>Roose Bolton</entity> accepts the suggestion . Seeing that <entity class="NE" id=10444>Ramsay</entity> is getting complacent , however , <entity class="NE" id=10445>Roose</entity> has Walda announce that she is pregnant with a boy . <entity class="NE" id=10446>Ramsay</entity> is clearly distressed by the news , which in turn delights <entity class="NE" id=10447>Sansa</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10448>Roose</entity> tells Ramsay about his conception . After dinner , <entity class="NE" id=10449>Ramsay</entity> expresses his distress at the possibility of the unborn child jeopardizing his claim on the <entity class="NE" id=10450>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10451>Roose</entity> reprimands his son for disgracing himself at dinner but seemingly dismisses his concern . He then shares the story of Ramsay’s birth ; <entity class="NE" id=10452>Roose</entity> raped a miller’s wife , who had married without his consent , after hanging her husband . A year later , she showed up with <entity class="NE" id=10453>Ramsay</entity> , claiming that the baby was his . <entity class="NE" id=10454>Roose</entity> nearly had her whipped and the baby drowned , but when <entity class="NE" id=10454>Roose</entity> laid eyes upon <entity class="NE" id=10455>Ramsay</entity> , he was convinced that he was his son and decided to keep him . He then reveals to Ramsay that <entity class="NE" id=10456>Stannis</entity> has an army at <entity class="NE" id=10457>Castle Black</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10458>Stannis</entity> plans to take the <entity class="NE" id=10459>Iron Throne</entity> and the road to King’s Landing passes through <entity class="NE" id=10460>Winterfell</entity> , which means that <entity class="NE" id=10458>Stannis</entity> also intends to take the <entity class="NE" id=10461>North</entity> . He wants Ramsay’s help in defeating <entity class="NE" id=10462>Stannis</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=10463>Ramsay</entity> agrees . <entity class="NE" id=10464>Old Old</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10465>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=10466>Jorah</entity> are attacked by the Stonemen . As <entity class="NE" id=10467>Jorah</entity> and Tyrion continue their journey to <entity class="NE" id=10468>Meereen</entity> , and following <entity class="NE" id=10467>Jorah</entity> 's violent reaction to a previous conversation , <entity class="NE" id=10469>Tyrion</entity> tries to civilize their relationship and asks where they are . As <entity class="NE" id=10470>Jorah</entity> stands up to look at the foggy ruins on the horizon , <entity class="NE" id=10471>Tyrion</entity> deduces that they are going to pass through the remains of <entity class="NE" id=10472>Old Valyria</entity> , a shorter route to <entity class="NE" id=10473>Meereen</entity> and one which pirates will avoid because of <entity class="NE" id=10474>Valyria</entity> 's reputation . <entity class="NE" id=10475>Tyrion</entity> is apprehensive , but still excited to see the ruins of what was once the greatest civilization in the world . As they catch glimpses of domes , towers and aqueducts , <entity class="NE" id=10476>Tyrion</entity> recites a poem about the <entity class="NE" id=10477>Doom</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=10478>Valyria</entity> , with <entity class="NE" id=10479>Jorah</entity> joining in at the end . Suddenly , through the fog , they see <entity class="NE" id=10480>Drogon</entity> fly into view . Although he had been hearing about the dragons for some time , <entity class="NE" id=10481>Tyrion</entity> is still utterly gobsmacked to see one in person . <entity class="NE" id=10482>Jorah</entity> is struck silent too , as <entity class="NE" id=10483>Drogon</entity> is even bigger and more majestic than when he left . So distracted are they that they do n't notice when the statues on a nearby aqueduct stand up and leap at the boat : they are <entity class="NE" id=10484>Stone Men</entity> - victims of greyscale so far gone that they have been sent to live out the rest of their lives in quarantine in the ruins . <entity class="NE" id=10485>Jorah</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=10486>Tyrion</entity> not to let them touch him and fights them off . However , as <entity class="NE" id=10487>Tyrion</entity> is tied up , he is cornered at one end of the boat with a stone man advancing on him while <entity class="NE" id=10488>Jorah</entity> battles more at the other end . Just before the stone man is able to grab him , <entity class="NE" id=10489>Tyrion</entity> rolls off of the boat and into the water to escape , where he is then pulled down by more stone men under the water . An undetermined amount of time later , <entity class="NE" id=10490>Tyrion</entity> wakes up and finds himself on a shore , dragged out of the water by <entity class="NE" id=10491>Jorah</entity> . After confirming to each other that they had not been touched by the stone men , <entity class="NE" id=10492>Jorah</entity> tells Tyrion that he hopes to find a fishing village and get a boat soon , otherwise they 'll have to walk all the way around <entity class="NE" id=10493>Slaver</entity> 's Bay to eventually reach <entity class="NE" id=10494>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=10495>Tyrion</entity> seems up for it and <entity class="NE" id=10496>Jorah</entity> goes to look for firewood so they can make camp . However , once out of <entity class="NE" id=10497>Tyrion</entity> 's view , he pulls back his sleeve to inspect the cracked skin on his wrist , confirming that he had been infected with greyscale during the fight with the stone men . He looks at <entity class="NE" id=10498>Tyrion</entity> and then glances in the direction of <entity class="NE" id=10499>Meereen</entity> , knowing that even if he dies , he needs to get <entity class="NE" id=10498>Tyrion</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=10500>Daenerys</entity> .
