<entity class="NE" id=9259>Cersei</entity> and Jaime adjust to a world without <entity class="NE" id=9260>Tywin</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9261>Varys</entity> reveals a conspiracy to <entity class="NE" id=9262>Tyrion</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9263>Dany</entity> faces a new threat to her rule . <entity class="NE" id=9264>Jon</entity> is caught between two kings . <entity class="NE" id=9265>Prologue</entity> - about 25 years ago , In the <entity class="NE" id=9266>Westerlands</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9267>Young Young</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9268>Melara</entity> , in the <entity class="NE" id=9269>Prologue</entity> flashback . A young <entity class="NE" id=9270>Cersei Lannister</entity> and her wary tag-along <entity class="NE" id=9271>Melara Hetherspoon</entity> are creeping through the woods of the <entity class="NE" id=9272>Westerlands</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9273>Melara</entity> does n't want to continue , but young <entity class="NE" id=9274>Cersei</entity> eggs her on . They reach a hut within the woods , which belongs to a <entity class="NE" id=9275>Woods</entity> witch named <entity class="NE" id=9276>Maggy</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9277>Unafraid</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9278>Cersei</entity> walks in first . Upon meeting this `` witch , '' <entity class="NE" id=9279>Cersei</entity> demands to have her future read . <entity class="NE" id=9280>Maggy</entity> is hesitant at first , but after <entity class="NE" id=9281>Cersei</entity> threatens to have her eyes gouged out , the witch relents . She says she will need a drop of <entity class="NE" id=9282>Cersei</entity> 's blood , so Cersei pricks her finger on a dagger . <entity class="NE" id=9283>Maggy</entity> tastes her blood and offers the young girl three questions . <entity class="NE" id=9284>Cersei</entity> 's first question was if she will marry the prince . <entity class="NE" id=9285>Maggy</entity> says she will not marry the prince , though she will marry the king , and become queen . She then asks if she and the king will have children , and <entity class="NE" id=9286>Maggy</entity> tells her that the king will have twenty children , but she will have three : gold will be their crowns - and gold their burial shrouds ( indicating that all three will predecease their mother ) . Finally , she tells <entity class="NE" id=9287>Cersei</entity> that her reign will not last : she will be queen , but eventually a younger and more beautiful queen is fated to take her place , along with everything she holds dear . In <entity class="NE" id=9288>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=9289>Cersei</entity> kissing her deceased father <entity class="NE" id=9290>Tywin</entity> . In the present , <entity class="NE" id=9291>Cersei</entity> arrives at the <entity class="NE" id=9292>Great Sept</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=9293>Baelor</entity> to pay respect to her deceased father <entity class="NE" id=9294>Tywin</entity> . Once inside the Sept , she chastises her brother Jaime for freeing their brother Tyrion and indirectly causing their father 's death . At <entity class="NE" id=9295>Tywin</entity> 's wake , <entity class="NE" id=9296>Cersei</entity> is approached by <entity class="NE" id=9297>Lancel Lannister</entity> . He has become a devout member of the <entity class="NE" id=9298>Sparrows</entity> , a religious cult , and asks <entity class="NE" id=9299>Cersei</entity> 's forgiveness for their adulterous relationship , as well as getting her husband <entity class="NE" id=9300>Robert Baratheon</entity> obscenely drunk on the day he died . <entity class="NE" id=9301>Cersei</entity> denies any knowledge of her husband 's murder , and shrugs off <entity class="NE" id=9302>Lancel</entity> . Loras in bed with <entity class="NE" id=9303>Olyvar</entity> . While in bed together , <entity class="NE" id=9304>Loras</entity> and the male prostitute Olyvar contemplate a birthmark on <entity class="NE" id=9304>Loras</entity> 's thigh which looks a little like Dorne . <entity class="NE" id=9305>Margaery</entity> walks in on them , complains about his lack of discretion and sends <entity class="NE" id=9306>Olyvar</entity> away . <entity class="NE" id=9307>Loras</entity> retorts that since his sexuality is an open secret anyway , there is n't much point in discretion . He also opines that as <entity class="NE" id=9308>Tywin</entity> is dead , no one will force <entity class="NE" id=9309>Cersei</entity> to marry him anymore . He points out how this will leave <entity class="NE" id=9310>Cersei</entity> in <entity class="NE" id=9311>King</entity> 's Landing , free to harass <entity class="NE" id=9312>Margaery</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9313>Margaery</entity> simply replies with `` perhaps . `` . In the <entity class="NE" id=9314>Free Cities</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=9315>Pentos</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9316>Varys</entity> speaks to Tyrion about his future . <entity class="NE" id=9317>Tyrion</entity> arrives in <entity class="NE" id=9318>Pentos</entity> , with the aid of <entity class="NE" id=9319>Varys</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9320>Varys</entity> tells Tyrion that he and <entity class="NE" id=9321>Illyrio Mopatis</entity> had worked together in secret to restore <entity class="HSE" id=9322>House Targaryen</entity> to the rule of <entity class="NE" id=9323>Westeros</entity> , but that their errors have left them in <entity class="NE" id=9324>Pentos</entity> , unable to return to <entity class="NE" id=9325>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=9326>Tyrion</entity> has descended into bitterness and self-loathing , seemingly determined to drink himself to death , but <entity class="NE" id=9327>Varys</entity> angrily snaps him out of his self pity , telling Tyrion that he still has talents that may yet be of use ; talents that he could use to seat the right candidate on the <entity class="NE" id=9328>Iron Throne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9329>Varys</entity> states that <entity class="NE" id=9330>Westeros</entity> is mired in chaos and on the brink of ruin ; the <entity class="NE" id=9331>Seven Kingdoms</entity> requires a ruler , one stronger than <entity class="NE" id=9332>Tommen</entity> yet gentler than <entity class="NE" id=9333>Stannis</entity> , beloved by the people , able to please the common folk and keep the nobility in line . When <entity class="NE" id=9334>Tyrion</entity> retorts that such a man does not exist , <entity class="NE" id=9335>Varys</entity> points out that he never said this ruler would be a man . <entity class="NE" id=9336>Varys</entity> offers Tyrion the choice of either drinking himself to death in <entity class="NE" id=9337>Pentos</entity> , or travelling with him to <entity class="NE" id=9338>Meereen</entity> to support <entity class="NE" id=9339>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> . After a moment , <entity class="NE" id=9340>Tyrion</entity> agrees . In <entity class="NE" id=9341>Slaver</entity> 's Bay . The <entity class="NE" id=9342>Unsullied</entity> remove the large gold harpy from the top of the <entity class="NE" id=9343>Great Pyramid</entity> in <entity class="NE" id=9344>Meereen</entity> to show the <entity class="NE" id=9345>Meereenese</entity> people they are under <entity class="NE" id=9346>Targaryen</entity> rule now and their old traditions are gone . One of the <entity class="NE" id=9347>Unsullied</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9348>White Rat</entity> , is seen walking into a brothel and pays a prostitute to lie with him and comfort him . He is subsequently murdered by a member of the <entity class="NE" id=9349>Sons</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=9350>Harpy</entity> , a resistance group operating in <entity class="NE" id=9351>Meereen</entity> . Upon being presented with the murderer 's mask ( left at the scene ) , <entity class="NE" id=9352>Daenerys</entity> orders <entity class="NE" id=9353>Grey Worm</entity> to find those responsible , and for the murdered soldier to be buried in the Temple of the Graces as a statement . <entity class="NE" id=9354>Dany</entity> attempts to visit her dragons . <entity class="NE" id=9355>Hizdahr zo Loraq</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9356>Daario Naharis</entity> return to <entity class="NE" id=9357>Meereen</entity> and declare that their mission to <entity class="NE" id=9358>Yunkai</entity> has been successful , and that the <entity class="NE" id=9359>Wise Masters</entity> will turn over power to a council of former slaves and former slave owners . In exchange , the <entity class="NE" id=9360>Wise Masters</entity> have asked that <entity class="NE" id=9361>Daenerys</entity> consent to the reopening of the fighting pits , an arena where slaves used to fight to the death . <entity class="NE" id=9362>Daenerys</entity> denies the request . Later , <entity class="NE" id=9363>Daario</entity> convinces her to reconsider , as his youth fighting in the pits gave him the fighting skills necessary for him to join the <entity class="NE" id=9364>Second Sons</entity> , where he met <entity class="NE" id=9365>Daenerys</entity> . Upon hearing that <entity class="NE" id=9366>Drogon</entity> has n't been seen in weeks , <entity class="NE" id=9367>Daario</entity> muses on the irony of a dragon-queen with no dragons . Later , <entity class="NE" id=9368>Daenerys</entity> attempts to visit <entity class="NE" id=9369>Viserion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9370>Rhaegal</entity> , whom she locked underground in the <entity class="NE" id=9371>Meereenese</entity> catacombs to prevent them from killing innocents or fleeing ( both of which <entity class="NE" id=9372>Drogon</entity> did ) . When she approaches them , they attempt to attack her , forcing her to briskly escape the room . In the <entity class="NE" id=9373>Vale</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9374>Littlefinger</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9375>Sansa</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9376>Sweetrobin Arryn</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=9377>Lord Royce</entity> at <entity class="NE" id=9378>Runestone</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=9379>Vale</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9380>Littlefinger</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9381>Sansa</entity> watch over <entity class="NE" id=9382>Lord Robin Arryn</entity> 's struggles while sparring with another young boy . While watching <entity class="NE" id=9383>Robin</entity> spar , <entity class="NE" id=9384>Sansa</entity> witnesses <entity class="NE" id=9385>Baelish</entity> receive a message , which he quickly hides . <entity class="NE" id=9386>Lord Lord</entity> has agreed to take <entity class="NE" id=9387>Robin</entity> as his ward and train him to fight , but is not optimistic of his abilities , stating `` he swings a sword like a girl with palsy . '' Though <entity class="NE" id=9388>Littlefinger</entity> told <entity class="NE" id=9389>Lord Royce</entity> that he and <entity class="NE" id=9390>Sansa</entity> would be traveling to the Fingers , they instead head west . <entity class="NE" id=9391>Sansa</entity> asks if they have anything to fear from <entity class="NE" id=9392>Lord Yohn</entity> ; Littlefinger explains that he does n't trust the retainers and soldiers who saw them , and is taking <entity class="NE" id=9391>Sansa</entity> somewhere the <entity class="NE" id=9393>Lannisters</entity> will never find her . <entity class="NE" id=9394>Podrick Podrick</entity> attempts to plan the next move for himself and <entity class="NE" id=9395>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=9396>Tarth</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=9395>Brienne</entity> tells him that she does n't want anyone following her . He reminds her of the oath she swore to <entity class="NE" id=9397>Jaime</entity> to find the Stark girls , but she states that <entity class="NE" id=9398>Arya</entity> did not want her protection . <entity class="NE" id=9399>Brienne</entity> also points out that <entity class="NE" id=9400>Pod</entity> was not safe in <entity class="NE" id=9401>King</entity> 's Landing and now that they are far away from the capital , he is safe and they can go their separate ways . <entity class="NE" id=9402>Littlefinger</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9403>Sansa</entity> 's carriage passes them , <entity class="NE" id=9404>Brienne</entity> unaware of how close her goal is . At the <entity class="NE" id=9405>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9406>Jon</entity> relay 's <entity class="NE" id=9407>Stannis</entity> ' offer to <entity class="NE" id=9408>Mance</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9409>Jon Jon</entity> 's attempts at training Olly are interrupted by <entity class="NE" id=9410>Melisandre</entity> , who has been sent to fetch <entity class="NE" id=9411>Jon</entity> for an audience with <entity class="NE" id=9412>Stannis</entity> . On the ride to the top of the <entity class="NE" id=9413>Wall</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9414>Jon</entity> is discomfited by <entity class="NE" id=9415>Melisandre</entity> 's presence and questions . <entity class="NE" id=9416>Stannis</entity> explains that he intends to retake the <entity class="NE" id=9417>North</entity> from <entity class="NE" id=9418>Lord Roose Bolton</entity> , but needs an army , and desires the <entity class="NE" id=9419>Free Folk</entity> to fight for him . He wants <entity class="NE" id=9420>Jon</entity> to convince <entity class="NE" id=9421>Mance Rayder</entity> to bend the knee and have the wildlings fight for him ; in exchange , he would set them free and give them their own land within <entity class="NE" id=9422>Westeros</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9423>Jon</entity> relays this message to <entity class="NE" id=9424>Mance</entity> , but he refuses to bend the knee ; to do so would be to show unforgivable weakness in the eyes of his people . Because he will not fight for <entity class="NE" id=9425>Stannis</entity> , his punishment is death by being burned alive . On the night of his execution , <entity class="NE" id=9426>Mance</entity> stands before <entity class="NE" id=9427>Stannis</entity> , and although he can not bend the knee , he offers him luck in the wars to come . <entity class="NE" id=9428>Mance</entity> is led to the stake . <entity class="NE" id=9429>Melisandre</entity> lights the pyre , and <entity class="NE" id=9430>Mance</entity> slowly begins to feel the agonizing pain of the fire . <entity class="NE" id=9431>Unable</entity> to watch him suffer any longer , <entity class="NE" id=9432>Jon</entity> turns and storms off . Others turn away from the scene as well , including <entity class="NE" id=9433>Gilly</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9434>Shireen</entity> . Just as <entity class="NE" id=9435>Mance</entity> begins to give in and start screaming , an arrow pierces his chest . It is shot by <entity class="NE" id=9436>Jon</entity> , giving the man he respected an easier death . <entity class="NE" id=9437>Mance</entity> dies before he feels the agony of the flames .
