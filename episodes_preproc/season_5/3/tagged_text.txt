In <entity class="NE" id=9648>Braavos</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9649>Arya</entity> sees the Many-Faced God . In <entity class="NE" id=9650>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=9651>Queen Margaery</entity> enjoys her new husband . <entity class="NE" id=9652>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9653>Varys</entity> walk the <entity class="NE" id=9654>Long Bridge</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=9655>Volantis</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=9656>King</entity> 's Landing . Tommen and <entity class="NE" id=9657>Margaery</entity> are wed. As <entity class="NE" id=9658>Cersei Lannister</entity> passes a large crowd on her way to the <entity class="NE" id=9659>Great Sept</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=9660>Baelor</entity> , she is increasingly annoyed as people cheer on <entity class="NE" id=9657>Margaery</entity> , completely ignoring her . <entity class="NE" id=9661>Tommen Tommen</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9662>Margaery Tyrell</entity> are wed , much to the dismay of <entity class="NE" id=9663>Cersei</entity> . That night , they consummate their marriage . They are elated and discuss their future together . <entity class="NE" id=9664>Tommen</entity> thinks that his mother is unhappy in <entity class="NE" id=9665>King</entity> 's Landing . Seeing an opportunity , <entity class="NE" id=9666>Margaery</entity> manipulates <entity class="NE" id=9667>Tommen</entity> into thinking that as long as <entity class="NE" id=9668>Cersei</entity> stays in King’s Landing , she will continue to treat him like a child , watching over him . The next morning , <entity class="NE" id=9669>Tommen</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9670>Cersei</entity> are out for a walk . <entity class="NE" id=9671>Tommen</entity> tells his mother that he thinks she should return to <entity class="NE" id=9672>Casterly Rock</entity> if it will make her happy , since she used to talk so fondly of it , but <entity class="NE" id=9673>Cersei</entity> declines . Deducing that this is Margaery’s doing , <entity class="NE" id=9674>Cersei</entity> pays her a visit , to find <entity class="NE" id=9675>Margaery</entity> busy gloating about her “exhausting” night with the King . Greeting her mother-in-law , <entity class="NE" id=9676>Margaery</entity> now more confident than ever , subtly rubs her queenship in Cersei’s face . Seeing herself losing , <entity class="NE" id=9677>Cersei</entity> walks away . In <entity class="NE" id=9678>Littlefinger</entity> 's brothel , the Sparrows attack the <entity class="NE" id=9679>High Septon</entity> as he engages the services of prostitutes dressed as the Seven . He is forced to walk naked through the streets while the <entity class="NE" id=9680>Sparrows</entity> proclaim him a sinner . Angered by the humiliation , he wants the <entity class="NE" id=9681>Small Council</entity> to arrest the <entity class="NE" id=9682>Sparrows</entity> and execute their leader , the <entity class="NE" id=9683>High Sparrow</entity> . Although unsympathetic , <entity class="NE" id=9684>Cersei</entity> decides to meet with the <entity class="NE" id=9685>High Sparrow</entity> , who turns out to be a humble man serving food to the poor , barefoot . The <entity class="NE" id=9686>High Sparrow</entity> makes no efforts to hide the actions of the other Sparrows . <entity class="NE" id=9687>Cersei</entity> tells him that he will not be arrested or executed , and that the <entity class="NE" id=9688>High Septon</entity> has been imprisoned instead , which surprises the <entity class="NE" id=9689>High Sparrow</entity> . Returning to the <entity class="NE" id=9690>Red Keep</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9691>Cersei</entity> has <entity class="NE" id=9692>Qyburn</entity> send a message to <entity class="NE" id=9693>Petyr Baelish</entity> . As <entity class="NE" id=9694>Qyburn</entity> writes , behind him , the body of <entity class="NE" id=9695>Gregor Clegane</entity> begins shaking under the sheet , but <entity class="NE" id=9694>Qyburn</entity> shushes him calmly . In the <entity class="NE" id=9696>North</entity> . While being served lunch by <entity class="NE" id=9697>Reek</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9698>Roose Bolton</entity> scolds <entity class="NE" id=9699>Ramsay</entity> on his recent flaying of <entity class="NE" id=9700>Lord Cerwyn</entity> and his family on what was supposed to be a routine tax collection . <entity class="NE" id=9701>Ramsay</entity> points out that he eventually got the taxes , but <entity class="NE" id=9702>Roose</entity> reminds his son that terror can not sustain their hold on the <entity class="NE" id=9703>North</entity> and that they are outnumbered if the other houses rise up in rebellion . With <entity class="NE" id=9704>Tywin Lannister's</entity> death , the pact between the <entity class="NE" id=9705>Lannisters</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=9706>Boltons</entity> is effectively dead . <entity class="NE" id=9707>Roose</entity> then declares that the best way to cement <entity class="NE" id=9708>Bolton</entity> control of the <entity class="NE" id=9709>North</entity> is through marriage . <entity class="NE" id=9710>Sansa Sansa</entity> is horrified to see <entity class="NE" id=9711>Moat Cailin</entity> . There is only one reason <entity class="NE" id=9712>Baelish</entity> could be taking her there - he means to return her to <entity class="NE" id=9713>Winterfell</entity> , straight into the arms of the <entity class="NE" id=9714>Boltons</entity> . Recalling their earlier discussion of a marriage proposal , <entity class="NE" id=9715>Sansa</entity> realizes that the proposal is not for him , but for her , and furiously declares that she would rather die than marry <entity class="NE" id=9716>Roose Bolton</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9717>Littlefinger</entity> corrects her and clarifies that she will be marrying <entity class="NE" id=9718>Ramsay Bolton</entity> , then calms her down by convincing her that nobody will look for her there , and suggesting that this is her best opportunity for revenge . <entity class="NE" id=9719>Sansa</entity> reluctantly agrees . The <entity class="NE" id=9720>Boltons</entity> greet <entity class="NE" id=9721>Sansa</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9722>Baelish</entity> At <entity class="NE" id=9723>Winterfell</entity> itself , the <entity class="NE" id=9720>Boltons</entity> and their households greet <entity class="NE" id=9721>Sansa</entity> and Littlefinger . After a tense moment , <entity class="NE" id=9724>Sansa</entity> graciously accepts <entity class="NE" id=9725>Roose</entity> 's welcome , putting on an air of politeness that protected her in <entity class="NE" id=9726>King</entity> 's Landing , while from afar , <entity class="NE" id=9727>Ramsay</entity> 's bedwarmer and secret lover , <entity class="NE" id=9728>Myranda</entity> , observes with jealousy and anger . <entity class="NE" id=9729>Sansa</entity> is later shown to her old room , seemingly foreign to her after all this time . To her surprise , the servant attending her welcomes her back and quietly assures her that , `` the <entity class="NE" id=9730>North</entity> remembers . '' Later , as <entity class="NE" id=9731>Sansa</entity> explores the castle , <entity class="NE" id=9732>Reek</entity> hides his face from her , but seems to have difficulty forcing himself not to call out to her . Elsewhere in the castle , <entity class="NE" id=9733>Baelish</entity> subtly warns <entity class="NE" id=9734>Ramsay</entity> against inflicting any harm on <entity class="NE" id=9735>Sansa</entity> , and discusses the situation with <entity class="NE" id=9736>Roose</entity> , who is suspicious of <entity class="NE" id=9737>Littlefinger</entity> 's motives in betraying the <entity class="NE" id=9738>Lannisters</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9739>Baelish</entity> points out that <entity class="NE" id=9740>Tywin</entity> is dead , <entity class="NE" id=9741>Jaime</entity> is one-handed and politically useless , and that <entity class="NE" id=9742>Cersei</entity> is about to be forced into the background by <entity class="NE" id=9743>Margaery</entity> , who is quite fond of <entity class="NE" id=9744>Sansa</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9745>Bolton</entity> , nevertheless , demands to read any messages <entity class="NE" id=9746>Littlefinger</entity> might send off back to the <entity class="NE" id=9747>Capital</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=9748>Wall</entity> . King <entity class="NE" id=9749>Stannis Baratheon</entity> tries unsuccessfully to convince the new Lord Commander of the <entity class="NE" id=9750>Night's Watch</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9751>Jon Snow</entity> , to accept his offer of legitimization . <entity class="NE" id=9752>Jon</entity> declines <entity class="NE" id=9753>Stannis</entity> 's offer and reiterates that his place is with the <entity class="NE" id=9754>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9755>Jon</entity> also reiterates the <entity class="NE" id=9756>Night's Watch</entity> 's neutrality in the affairs of the <entity class="NE" id=9757>Seven Kingdoms</entity> and asks Stannis when he plans to leave ; <entity class="NE" id=9758>Castle Black</entity> 's stores are insufficient to feed the <entity class="NE" id=9756>Night's Watch</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9759>Stannis</entity> 's army , and the wildling prisoners indefinitely . <entity class="NE" id=9760>Stannis</entity> confirms that his army will leave soon enough to confront the Boltons at <entity class="NE" id=9761>Winterfell</entity> before the winter snows trap them at the <entity class="NE" id=9762>Wall</entity> . He leaves the fate of the wildling prisoners in <entity class="NE" id=9763>Jon</entity> 's hands , allowing <entity class="NE" id=9763>Jon</entity> to decide whether to execute them or to see if <entity class="NE" id=9764>Tormund</entity> is more willing to negotiate than <entity class="NE" id=9765>Mance</entity> . When <entity class="NE" id=9766>Stannis</entity> suggests appointing <entity class="NE" id=9767>Alliser Thorne</entity> as the new commander of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea , <entity class="NE" id=9768>Jon</entity> retorts that `` it is better to have your enemies close by than far away . '' As <entity class="NE" id=9769>Davos Seaworth</entity> prepares to leave with his liege , he invites <entity class="NE" id=9770>Jon</entity> to ponder on the second-to-last stanza on the <entity class="NE" id=9771>Night's Watch</entity> oath : `` I am the shield that guards the realms of men . '' He also assures <entity class="NE" id=9772>Jon</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=9773>Stannis</entity> 's leadership advice is offered because the king has taken a liking to him . Later , at the mess hall , <entity class="NE" id=9774>Lord Commander Jon Snow</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=9775>Sam</entity> about <entity class="NE" id=9776>Maester Aemon</entity> and it is learned his health is waning and entrusts his care in <entity class="NE" id=9775>Sam</entity> 's hands . <entity class="NE" id=9777>Jon</entity> begins assigning roles to members of the <entity class="NE" id=9778>Watch</entity> . He assigns one black brother to oversee the digging of a new latrine pit to accommodate the wildling prisoners . <entity class="NE" id=9779>Snow</entity> also shows respect to <entity class="NE" id=9780>Ser Alliser Thorne</entity> by appointing him as the new First Ranger , commending his experience . Finally , <entity class="NE" id=9781>Lord Commander Snow</entity> assigns <entity class="NE" id=9782>Janos Slynt</entity> with the task of restoring and manning the abandoned castle <entity class="NE" id=9783>Greyguard</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9784>Slynt</entity> refuses <entity class="NE" id=9785>Jon</entity> not once , but three times . Even after being warned that he is disobeying a direct order , he flippantly tells <entity class="NE" id=9786>Jon</entity> that he can take his order and 'shove it up his bastard arse . ' Having publicly disobeyed and insulted <entity class="NE" id=9787>Jon</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=9788>Lord Commander</entity> orders <entity class="NE" id=9789>Janos</entity> taken outside , and calls for <entity class="NE" id=9790>Olly</entity> to fetch him his sword . Ser Ser briefly hesitates but then moves out of the way to let <entity class="NE" id=9791>Dolorous Edd</entity> and others grab <entity class="NE" id=9792>Slynt</entity> , who angrily protests that he has important friends at court and dismisses the matter as a scare tactic . Small justice for <entity class="NE" id=9793>Ned Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9794>Jon</entity> has Janos dragged out into the courtyard where , obedient to the laws of his father <entity class="NE" id=9795>Eddard Stark</entity> - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - he prepares to publicly behead him for treason . <entity class="NE" id=9796>Slynt</entity> 's bluster is lost , and the man who once took a baby girl from her mother 's arms and killed her starts crying and begging for mercy , saying he will do whatever <entity class="NE" id=9797>Jon</entity> asks and that he is afraid . <entity class="NE" id=9798>Jon</entity> hesitates for a moment , but then fixes his nerve and executes the cowardly former <entity class="NE" id=9799>Commander</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=9800>City Watch</entity> with a single swing of his sword - incidentally exacting small justice on one of the men who betrayed his own father to his death and murdered <entity class="NE" id=9801>Robert Baratheon</entity> 's children . From across the courtyard , <entity class="NE" id=9802>Stannis Baratheon</entity> sees <entity class="NE" id=9803>Jon</entity> behead <entity class="NE" id=9804>Janos</entity> for refusing his orders , and slightly nods in approval . In the <entity class="NE" id=9805>Free Cities</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9806>Arya</entity> is accosted by The <entity class="NE" id=9807>Waif</entity> In <entity class="NE" id=9808>Braavos</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9809>Arya Stark</entity> has been put to work cleaning the main sanctuary of the House of <entity class="NE" id=9810>Black</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9811>White</entity> . She watches as <entity class="NE" id=9812>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> assists a supplicant in drinking from the temple 's well . She protests to Jaqen that she wants to learn , but he brushes off her discontent . Later on , <entity class="NE" id=9813>Arya</entity> is accosted in her room by The <entity class="NE" id=9814>Waif</entity> , who repeatedly asks her who she is , hitting her when she gives the expected response of `` no one . '' <entity class="NE" id=9815>Jaqen</entity> eventually arrives and demands to know what is going on , as the <entity class="NE" id=9816>Waif</entity> has overstepped her bounds . He does , however , point out that <entity class="NE" id=9817>Arya</entity> can not be no one , as she is wearing <entity class="NE" id=9818>Arya Stark</entity> 's clothes , is in possession of silver stolen by <entity class="NE" id=9818>Arya Stark</entity> , and was about to attack the Waif using <entity class="NE" id=9818>Arya Stark</entity> 's sword . Realizing his point , <entity class="NE" id=9819>Arya</entity> binds her old clothing to a rock and tosses it into the lagoon along with the stolen silver . She can not bring herself to discard <entity class="NE" id=9820>Needle</entity> so easily , and instead hides it within a sea wall nearby . Back at the House , <entity class="NE" id=9821>Jaqen</entity> allows <entity class="NE" id=9822>Arya</entity> to progress to an inner chamber where she is to assist the <entity class="NE" id=9823>Waif</entity> in stripping and washing corpses . The <entity class="NE" id=9824>Waif</entity> is silent when <entity class="NE" id=9825>Arya</entity> asks what happens to the bodies after they are cleaned . The <entity class="NE" id=9826>Red Priestess</entity> . Meanwhile , further south in the <entity class="NE" id=9827>Free Cities</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9828>Tyrion Lannister</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9829>Varys</entity> finally arrive at <entity class="NE" id=9830>Volantis</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9831>Sick</entity> of the carriage they 've been riding in , <entity class="NE" id=9832>Tyrion</entity> again dismisses the dangers and insists they leave to explore . The pair move through the <entity class="NE" id=9833>Long Bridge</entity> 's markets , where <entity class="NE" id=9834>Varys</entity> explains the meaning of the various tattoos Volantene slaves must sport . <entity class="NE" id=9835>Varys</entity> nearly loses <entity class="NE" id=9836>Tyrion</entity> , but finds him observing the sermon of a Red Priestess . <entity class="NE" id=9837>Tyrion</entity> claims curiosity , since <entity class="NE" id=9838>Thoros</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=9839>Myr</entity> was the only Red Priest in <entity class="NE" id=9840>King</entity> 's Landing . The <entity class="NE" id=9841>Red Priestess</entity> evangelizes in <entity class="NE" id=9842>High Valyrian</entity> , telling the tale of how she was once a slave herself . Like another Red Priestess , she preaches of a prophesied savior , a <entity class="NE" id=9843>Dragon Queen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9844>Tyrion</entity> 's interest in the scene wanes when the <entity class="NE" id=9845>Priestess</entity> halts in her sermon and stares directly into his eyes . <entity class="NE" id=9846>Tyrion</entity> next leads <entity class="NE" id=9847>Varys</entity> to a brothel . Catching sight of a prostitute dressed as <entity class="NE" id=9848>Daenerys</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9849>Varys</entity> tells Tyrion that a woman who inspires both sermons and whores is probably worth meeting . <entity class="NE" id=9850>Tyrion</entity> woos a dark-haired prostitute , but when she finally agrees to service him , he finds that he ca n't bring himself to patronize her . He then goes to urinate off the side of the bridge , with <entity class="NE" id=9851>Varys</entity> losing sight of him . As <entity class="NE" id=9852>Tyrion</entity> finishes , he is abducted by <entity class="NE" id=9853>Jorah Mormont</entity> , who declares that he is taking him to `` the queen . `` .
