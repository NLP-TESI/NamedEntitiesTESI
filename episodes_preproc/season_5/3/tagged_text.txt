In <entity id=9680>Braavos</entity> , <entity id=9681>Arya</entity> sees the Many-Faced God . In <entity id=9682>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity id=9683>Queen Margaery</entity> enjoys her new husband . <entity id=9684>Tyrion</entity> and <entity id=9685>Varys</entity> walk the <entity id=9686>Long Bridge</entity> of <entity id=9687>Volantis</entity> . In <entity id=9688>King</entity> 's Landing . Tommen and <entity id=9689>Margaery</entity> are wed. As <entity id=9690>Cersei Lannister</entity> passes a large crowd on her way to the <entity id=9691>Great Sept</entity> of <entity id=9692>Baelor</entity> , she is increasingly annoyed as people cheer on <entity id=9689>Margaery</entity> , completely ignoring her . <entity id=9693>Tommen Tommen</entity> and <entity id=9694>Margaery Tyrell</entity> are wed , much to the dismay of <entity id=9695>Cersei</entity> . That night , they consummate their marriage . They are elated and discuss their future together . <entity id=9696>Tommen</entity> thinks that his mother is unhappy in <entity id=9697>King</entity> 's Landing . Seeing an opportunity , <entity id=9698>Margaery</entity> manipulates <entity id=9699>Tommen</entity> into thinking that as long as <entity id=9700>Cersei</entity> stays in King’s Landing , she will continue to treat him like a child , watching over him . The next morning , <entity id=9701>Tommen</entity> and <entity id=9702>Cersei</entity> are out for a walk . <entity id=9703>Tommen</entity> tells his mother that he thinks she should return to <entity id=9704>Casterly Rock</entity> if it will make her happy , since she used to talk so fondly of it , but <entity id=9705>Cersei</entity> declines . Deducing that this is Margaery’s doing , <entity id=9706>Cersei</entity> pays her a visit , to find <entity id=9707>Margaery</entity> busy gloating about her “exhausting” night with the King . Greeting her mother-in-law , <entity id=9708>Margaery</entity> now more confident than ever , subtly rubs her queenship in Cersei’s face . Seeing herself losing , <entity id=9709>Cersei</entity> walks away . In <entity id=9710>Littlefinger</entity> 's brothel , the Sparrows attack the <entity id=9711>High Septon</entity> as he engages the services of prostitutes dressed as the Seven . He is forced to walk naked through the streets while the <entity id=9712>Sparrows</entity> proclaim him a sinner . Angered by the humiliation , he wants the <entity id=9713>Small Council</entity> to arrest the <entity id=9714>Sparrows</entity> and execute their leader , the <entity id=9715>High Sparrow</entity> . Although unsympathetic , <entity id=9716>Cersei</entity> decides to meet with the <entity id=9717>High Sparrow</entity> , who turns out to be a humble man serving food to the poor , barefoot . The <entity id=9718>High Sparrow</entity> makes no efforts to hide the actions of the other Sparrows . <entity id=9719>Cersei</entity> tells him that he will not be arrested or executed , and that the <entity id=9720>High Septon</entity> has been imprisoned instead , which surprises the <entity id=9721>High Sparrow</entity> . Returning to the <entity id=9722>Red Keep</entity> , <entity id=9723>Cersei</entity> has <entity id=9724>Qyburn</entity> send a message to <entity id=9725>Petyr Baelish</entity> . As <entity id=9726>Qyburn</entity> writes , behind him , the body of <entity id=9727>Gregor Clegane</entity> begins shaking under the sheet , but <entity id=9726>Qyburn</entity> shushes him calmly . In the <entity id=9728>North</entity> . While being served lunch by <entity id=9729>Reek</entity> , <entity id=9730>Roose Bolton</entity> scolds <entity id=9731>Ramsay</entity> on his recent flaying of <entity id=9732>Lord Cerwyn</entity> and his family on what was supposed to be a routine tax collection . <entity id=9733>Ramsay</entity> points out that he eventually got the taxes , but <entity id=9734>Roose</entity> reminds his son that terror can not sustain their hold on the <entity id=9735>North</entity> and that they are outnumbered if the other houses rise up in rebellion . With <entity id=9736>Tywin Lannister's</entity> death , the pact between the <entity id=9737>Lannisters</entity> and the <entity id=9738>Boltons</entity> is effectively dead . <entity id=9739>Roose</entity> then declares that the best way to cement <entity id=9740>Bolton</entity> control of the <entity id=9741>North</entity> is through marriage . <entity id=9742>Sansa Sansa</entity> is horrified to see <entity id=9743>Moat Cailin</entity> . There is only one reason <entity id=9744>Baelish</entity> could be taking her there - he means to return her to <entity id=9745>Winterfell</entity> , straight into the arms of the <entity id=9746>Boltons</entity> . Recalling their earlier discussion of a marriage proposal , <entity id=9747>Sansa</entity> realizes that the proposal is not for him , but for her , and furiously declares that she would rather die than marry <entity id=9748>Roose Bolton</entity> . <entity id=9749>Littlefinger</entity> corrects her and clarifies that she will be marrying <entity id=9750>Ramsay Bolton</entity> , then calms her down by convincing her that nobody will look for her there , and suggesting that this is her best opportunity for revenge . <entity id=9751>Sansa</entity> reluctantly agrees . The <entity id=9752>Boltons</entity> greet <entity id=9753>Sansa</entity> and <entity id=9754>Baelish</entity> At <entity id=9755>Winterfell</entity> itself , the <entity id=9752>Boltons</entity> and their households greet <entity id=9753>Sansa</entity> and Littlefinger . After a tense moment , <entity id=9756>Sansa</entity> graciously accepts <entity id=9757>Roose</entity> 's welcome , putting on an air of politeness that protected her in <entity id=9758>King</entity> 's Landing , while from afar , <entity id=9759>Ramsay</entity> 's bedwarmer and secret lover , <entity id=9760>Myranda</entity> , observes with jealousy and anger . <entity id=9761>Sansa</entity> is later shown to her old room , seemingly foreign to her after all this time . To her surprise , the servant attending her welcomes her back and quietly assures her that , `` the <entity id=9762>North</entity> remembers . '' Later , as <entity id=9763>Sansa</entity> explores the castle , <entity id=9764>Reek</entity> hides his face from her , but seems to have difficulty forcing himself not to call out to her . Elsewhere in the castle , <entity id=9765>Baelish</entity> subtly warns <entity id=9766>Ramsay</entity> against inflicting any harm on <entity id=9767>Sansa</entity> , and discusses the situation with <entity id=9768>Roose</entity> , who is suspicious of <entity id=9769>Littlefinger</entity> 's motives in betraying the <entity id=9770>Lannisters</entity> . <entity id=9771>Baelish</entity> points out that <entity id=9772>Tywin</entity> is dead , <entity id=9773>Jaime</entity> is one-handed and politically useless , and that <entity id=9774>Cersei</entity> is about to be forced into the background by <entity id=9775>Margaery</entity> , who is quite fond of <entity id=9776>Sansa</entity> . <entity id=9777>Bolton</entity> , nevertheless , demands to read any messages <entity id=9778>Littlefinger</entity> might send off back to the <entity id=9779>Capital</entity> . At the <entity id=9780>Wall</entity> . King <entity id=9781>Stannis Baratheon</entity> tries unsuccessfully to convince the new Lord Commander of the <entity id=9782>Night's Watch</entity> , <entity id=9783>Jon Snow</entity> , to accept his offer of legitimization . <entity id=9784>Jon</entity> declines <entity id=9785>Stannis</entity> 's offer and reiterates that his place is with the <entity id=9786>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity id=9787>Jon</entity> also reiterates the <entity id=9788>Night's Watch</entity> 's neutrality in the affairs of the <entity id=9789>Seven Kingdoms</entity> and asks Stannis when he plans to leave ; <entity id=9790>Castle Black</entity> 's stores are insufficient to feed the <entity id=9788>Night's Watch</entity> , <entity id=9791>Stannis</entity> 's army , and the wildling prisoners indefinitely . <entity id=9792>Stannis</entity> confirms that his army will leave soon enough to confront the Boltons at <entity id=9793>Winterfell</entity> before the winter snows trap them at the <entity id=9794>Wall</entity> . He leaves the fate of the wildling prisoners in <entity id=9795>Jon</entity> 's hands , allowing <entity id=9795>Jon</entity> to decide whether to execute them or to see if <entity id=9796>Tormund</entity> is more willing to negotiate than <entity id=9797>Mance</entity> . When <entity id=9798>Stannis</entity> suggests appointing <entity id=9799>Alliser Thorne</entity> as the new commander of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea , <entity id=9800>Jon</entity> retorts that `` it is better to have your enemies close by than far away . '' As <entity id=9801>Davos Seaworth</entity> prepares to leave with his liege , he invites <entity id=9802>Jon</entity> to ponder on the second-to-last stanza on the <entity id=9803>Night's Watch</entity> oath : `` I am the shield that guards the realms of men . '' He also assures <entity id=9804>Jon</entity> that <entity id=9805>Stannis</entity> 's leadership advice is offered because the king has taken a liking to him . Later , at the mess hall , <entity id=9806>Lord Commander Jon Snow</entity> asks <entity id=9807>Sam</entity> about <entity id=9808>Maester Aemon</entity> and it is learned his health is waning and entrusts his care in <entity id=9807>Sam</entity> 's hands . <entity id=9809>Jon</entity> begins assigning roles to members of the <entity id=9810>Watch</entity> . He assigns one black brother to oversee the digging of a new latrine pit to accommodate the wildling prisoners . <entity id=9811>Snow</entity> also shows respect to <entity id=9812>Ser Alliser Thorne</entity> by appointing him as the new First Ranger , commending his experience . Finally , <entity id=9813>Lord Commander Snow</entity> assigns <entity id=9814>Janos Slynt</entity> with the task of restoring and manning the abandoned castle <entity id=9815>Greyguard</entity> . <entity id=9816>Slynt</entity> refuses <entity id=9817>Jon</entity> not once , but three times . Even after being warned that he is disobeying a direct order , he flippantly tells <entity id=9818>Jon</entity> that he can take his order and 'shove it up his bastard arse . ' Having publicly disobeyed and insulted <entity id=9819>Jon</entity> , the <entity id=9820>Lord Commander</entity> orders <entity id=9821>Janos</entity> taken outside , and calls for <entity id=9822>Olly</entity> to fetch him his sword . <entity id=9823>Ser Ser</entity> briefly hesitates but then moves out of the way to let <entity id=9824>Dolorous Edd</entity> and others grab <entity id=9825>Slynt</entity> , who angrily protests that he has important friends at court and dismisses the matter as a scare tactic . Small justice for <entity id=9826>Ned Stark</entity> . <entity id=9827>Jon</entity> has Janos dragged out into the courtyard where , obedient to the laws of his father <entity id=9828>Eddard Stark</entity> - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - he prepares to publicly behead him for treason . <entity id=9829>Slynt</entity> 's bluster is lost , and the man who once took a baby girl from her mother 's arms and killed her starts crying and begging for mercy , saying he will do whatever <entity id=9830>Jon</entity> asks and that he is afraid . <entity id=9831>Jon</entity> hesitates for a moment , but then fixes his nerve and executes the cowardly former <entity id=9832>Commander</entity> of the <entity id=9833>City Watch</entity> with a single swing of his sword - incidentally exacting small justice on one of the men who betrayed his own father to his death and murdered <entity id=9834>Robert Baratheon</entity> 's children . From across the courtyard , <entity id=9835>Stannis Baratheon</entity> sees <entity id=9836>Jon</entity> behead <entity id=9837>Janos</entity> for refusing his orders , and slightly nods in approval . In the <entity id=9838>Free Cities</entity> . <entity id=9839>Arya</entity> is accosted by The <entity id=9840>Waif</entity> In <entity id=9841>Braavos</entity> , <entity id=9842>Arya Stark</entity> has been put to work cleaning the main sanctuary of the House of <entity id=9843>Black</entity> and <entity id=9844>White</entity> . She watches as <entity id=9845>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> assists a supplicant in drinking from the temple 's well . She protests to Jaqen that she wants to learn , but he brushes off her discontent . Later on , <entity id=9846>Arya</entity> is accosted in her room by The <entity id=9847>Waif</entity> , who repeatedly asks her who she is , hitting her when she gives the expected response of `` no one . '' <entity id=9848>Jaqen</entity> eventually arrives and demands to know what is going on , as the <entity id=9849>Waif</entity> has overstepped her bounds . He does , however , point out that <entity id=9850>Arya</entity> can not be no one , as she is wearing <entity id=9851>Arya Stark</entity> 's clothes , is in possession of silver stolen by <entity id=9851>Arya Stark</entity> , and was about to attack the Waif using <entity id=9851>Arya Stark</entity> 's sword . Realizing his point , <entity id=9852>Arya</entity> binds her old clothing to a rock and tosses it into the lagoon along with the stolen silver . She can not bring herself to discard <entity id=9853>Needle</entity> so easily , and instead hides it within a sea wall nearby . Back at the House , <entity id=9854>Jaqen</entity> allows <entity id=9855>Arya</entity> to progress to an inner chamber where she is to assist the <entity id=9856>Waif</entity> in stripping and washing corpses . The <entity id=9857>Waif</entity> is silent when <entity id=9858>Arya</entity> asks what happens to the bodies after they are cleaned . The <entity id=9859>Red Priestess</entity> . Meanwhile , further south in the <entity id=9860>Free Cities</entity> , <entity id=9861>Tyrion Lannister</entity> and <entity id=9862>Varys</entity> finally arrive at <entity id=9863>Volantis</entity> . <entity id=9864>Sick</entity> of the carriage they 've been riding in , <entity id=9865>Tyrion</entity> again dismisses the dangers and insists they leave to explore . The pair move through the <entity id=9866>Long Bridge</entity> 's markets , where <entity id=9867>Varys</entity> explains the meaning of the various tattoos Volantene slaves must sport . <entity id=9868>Varys</entity> nearly loses <entity id=9869>Tyrion</entity> , but finds him observing the sermon of a Red Priestess . <entity id=9870>Tyrion</entity> claims curiosity , since <entity id=9871>Thoros</entity> of <entity id=9872>Myr</entity> was the only Red Priest in <entity id=9873>King</entity> 's Landing . The <entity id=9874>Red Priestess</entity> evangelizes in <entity id=9875>High Valyrian</entity> , telling the tale of how she was once a slave herself . Like another Red Priestess , she preaches of a prophesied savior , a <entity id=9876>Dragon Queen</entity> . <entity id=9877>Tyrion</entity> 's interest in the scene wanes when the <entity id=9878>Priestess</entity> halts in her sermon and stares directly into his eyes . <entity id=9879>Tyrion</entity> next leads <entity id=9880>Varys</entity> to a brothel . Catching sight of a prostitute dressed as <entity id=9881>Daenerys</entity> , <entity id=9882>Varys</entity> tells Tyrion that a woman who inspires both sermons and whores is probably worth meeting . <entity id=9883>Tyrion</entity> woos a dark-haired prostitute , but when she finally agrees to service him , he finds that he ca n't bring himself to patronize her . He then goes to urinate off the side of the bridge , with <entity id=9884>Varys</entity> losing sight of him . As <entity id=9885>Tyrion</entity> finishes , he is abducted by <entity id=9886>Jorah Mormont</entity> , who declares that he is taking him to `` the queen . `` .
