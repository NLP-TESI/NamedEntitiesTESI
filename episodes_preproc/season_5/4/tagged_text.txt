The <entity id=9887>Faith Militant</entity> grow increasingly aggressive ; Jaime and <entity id=9888>Bronn</entity> head south ; <entity id=9889>Ellaria</entity> and the <entity id=9890>Sand Snakes</entity> vow vengeance . In <entity id=9891>King</entity> 's Landing . At a <entity id=9892>Small Council</entity> meeting , <entity id=9893>Master</entity> of <entity id=9894>Coin Mace Tyrell</entity> brings bad news that the <entity id=9895>Iron Bank</entity> of <entity id=9896>Braavos</entity> is starting to call in its debts from <entity id=9897>Westeros</entity> . They have started by calling in a tenth of the <entity id=9898>Iron Throne</entity> 's current debts to the bank , which it can only afford half of as rebuilding the <entity id=9899>Royal Fleet</entity> was also a massive expense . <entity id=9900>Mace</entity> offers that <entity id=9901>House Tyrell</entity> could front the money for the time being , but <entity id=9902>Cersei</entity> clearly does not want to give the <entity id=9903>Tyrells</entity> more power over the crown . Instead , she says that they will send <entity id=9904>Mace</entity> himself to <entity id=9905>Braavos</entity> to negotiate for more time , because sending such a high-ranking official will show the bank how seriously they take their large debts . <entity id=9906>Mace</entity> is oblivious that this is also <entity id=9907>Cersei</entity> 's way of removing him from the capital , and takes it as a high honor - as well as that <entity id=9907>Cersei</entity> will send <entity id=9908>Ser Meryn Trant</entity> of the <entity id=9909>Kingsguard</entity> along to `` guard '' him . After he leaves , <entity id=9910>Pycelle</entity> bitterly points out that the <entity id=9911>Small Council</entity> is growing even smaller ( the only three members left in the capital are <entity id=9910>Pycelle</entity> , <entity id=9912>Cersei</entity> , and her lackey Qyburn ) , but she says it has n't quite grown small enough yet . <entity id=9913>Cersei</entity> meets with the <entity id=9914>High Sparrow</entity> . <entity id=9915>Cersei</entity> then meets with the <entity id=9916>High Sparrow</entity> , who by her influence , has been elected as the new High Septon of the <entity id=9917>Faith</entity> of the Seven . <entity id=9918>Cersei</entity> is trying to build up a new alliance between the <entity id=9919>Crown</entity> and the <entity id=9920>Faith</entity> , as a counterweight against the large political influence the <entity id=9921>Tyrells</entity> now possess . <entity id=9922>Cersei</entity> points out to the <entity id=9923>High Sparrow</entity> that the War of the <entity id=9924>Five Kings</entity> has devastated much of the countryside , resulting in septs being burned , clergymen attacked , and even <entity id=9925>Silent Sisters</entity> raped . Bodies of holy men are piling up in the streets . The <entity id=9926>High Sparrow</entity> admits that wars make men obey the sword more than the gods . <entity id=9927>Cersei</entity> points out that before the <entity id=9928>Targaryens</entity> , the military order known as the <entity id=9929>Faith Militant</entity> dispensed the justice of the Seven . The <entity id=9930>High Septon</entity> is confused , as the <entity id=9931>Targaryens</entity> disbanded the <entity id=9932>Faith Militant</entity> over two centuries ago . <entity id=9933>Cersei</entity> explains that , as part of the new alliance she hopes to build between the <entity id=9934>Crown</entity> and the <entity id=9935>Faith</entity> , she will tell her son to repeal the law and allow the <entity id=9936>Faith Militant</entity> to be reestablished and re-armed : an army whose purpose is to defend the <entity id=9935>Faith</entity> , holy men , and the smallfolk - and which will incidentally be turned against the <entity id=9934>Crown</entity> 's enemies . She then advises him that there is a great sinner in their midst who has been shielded by gold and power . The <entity id=9937>High Sparrow</entity> replies with a wish for The Father to judge him justly . The new <entity id=9938>Faith Militant</entity> storm the streets of <entity id=9939>King</entity> 's Landing , attacking taverns , brothels , and street vendors selling idols from other religions . The <entity id=9940>City Watch</entity> look on , helpless , and do not intervene . They ransack <entity id=9941>Littlefinger</entity> 's brothel , dragging prostitutes like <entity id=9942>Marei</entity> out into the street by their hair . <entity id=9943>Olyvar</entity> is struck and ignored as they barge in ; he then sees that in another room they have singled out a man having sex with one of the male prostitutes , and approach him with a knife . <entity id=9944>Olyvar</entity> flees . Tommen attempts to have his brother-in-law <entity id=9945>Loras</entity> released , but fails . As a sign of their zealotry , the <entity id=9946>Faith Militant</entity> have the Seven-Pointed Star symbol of the <entity id=9947>Faith</entity> carved into their foreheads - including <entity id=9948>Lancel</entity> , who leads a squad of the <entity id=9946>Faith Militant</entity> to apprehend <entity id=9949>Loras Tyrell</entity> while he is sparring in the practice yard . <entity id=9950>Lancel</entity> proclaims that <entity id=9951>Loras</entity> ' sexual perversions are sins against the laws of gods and men , and <entity id=9951>Loras</entity> is dragged off . <entity id=9952>Margaery Margaery</entity> is furious at <entity id=9953>Tommen</entity> for her brother 's arrest , then tries to manipulate him by weeping at how hurt she is that he let this happen to <entity id=9954>Loras</entity> . Tommen then goes to his mother and , briefly standing up to her , demands that <entity id=9955>Loras</entity> be released at once . <entity id=9956>Cersei</entity> calmly points out that she did n't arrest <entity id=9957>Loras</entity> , the <entity id=9958>Faith Militant</entity> simply dragged him off and imprisoned him , so he should ask the <entity id=9959>High Sparrow</entity> to release him . Tommen naively thinks the <entity id=9960>High Sparrow</entity> will simply do as he requests , so he heads to the <entity id=9961>Great Sept</entity> of <entity id=9962>Baelor</entity> with five <entity id=9963>Kingsguard</entity> and several Lannister guards . The path to the <entity id=9964>Great Sept</entity> is blocked by the <entity id=9965>Faith Militant</entity> , who say that the <entity id=9966>High Sparrow</entity> is praying and does not wish to be disturbed . The <entity id=9967>Kingsguard</entity> request that <entity id=9968>Tommen</entity> let them kill the <entity id=9969>Faith Militant</entity> to pass . <entity id=9970>Tommen</entity> is surprised at this and does not want to risk bloodshed escalating matters - particularly , shedding blood on holy ground . <entity id=9971>Unsure</entity> of what to do , the mob of commoners behind him starts shouting that he is really a bastard and an abomination of incest . Realizing this is not going to end well , <entity id=9972>Tommen</entity> meekly withdraws back to the <entity id=9973>Red Keep</entity> . <entity id=9974>Margaery</entity> is even more upset at how ineffectual young <entity id=9975>Tommen</entity> was , so she leaves saying that she is going to bring her grandmother <entity id=9976>Olenna</entity> back to the capital to deal with this . In <entity id=9977>Dorne</entity> . <entity id=9978>Jaime Lannister</entity> and <entity id=9979>Ser Bronn</entity> are on a Pentoshi merchant ship , which is headed to <entity id=9980>Oldtown</entity> in the Reach . They sail past <entity id=9981>Tarth</entity> , off the coast of the <entity id=9982>Stormlands</entity> , which <entity id=9983>Jaime</entity> mistakenly identifies as <entity id=9984>Estermont</entity> . The captain corrects him , stating that they are sailing through the <entity id=9985>Sapphire Isle</entity> , which reminds him of <entity id=9986>Brienne</entity> . Jaime explains to Bronn that he bribed the captain to let them take a small boat to shore as they pass <entity id=9987>Dorne</entity> , and they will land just outside of <entity id=9988>Sunspear</entity> and the adjacent <entity id=9989>Water Gardens</entity> . Below decks , <entity id=9990>Bronn</entity> remarks on why <entity id=9991>Jaime</entity> must want to go and protect <entity id=9992>Princess Myrcella</entity> for himself : he 's the one who let <entity id=9993>Tyrion</entity> escape , and he hopes this will make up for that . Jaime curtly says that <entity id=9994>Varys</entity> did ( when in fact , <entity id=9995>Jaime</entity> forced <entity id=9994>Varys</entity> to help him free Tyrion ) . <entity id=9996>Bronn</entity> says that if <entity id=9997>Jaime</entity> ever sees <entity id=9998>Tyrion</entity> again Jaime should give him his regards ; Jaime angrily says that if he sees his brother again , he 's going to split him in two for murdering their father <entity id=9999>Tywin</entity> . Jaime uses his metal hand to stop a blade . <entity id=10000>Bronn</entity> rows the pair ashore at dusk , though <entity id=10001>Jaime</entity> ca n't help row with his one hand . When they awake the next morning <entity id=10002>Bronn</entity> kills a snake that was near <entity id=10003>Jaime</entity> 's head and roasts it up for breakfast . <entity id=10004>Bronn</entity> is worried that the ship 's captain will subsequently spread word that a Lannister is in <entity id=10005>Dorne</entity> ; <entity id=10006>Jaime</entity> says he bribed him with a large bag of gold , but <entity id=10004>Bronn</entity> still worries . A mounted patrol soon comes by , however , and sees their tracks in the sand . <entity id=10007>Jaime</entity> and <entity id=10008>Bronn</entity> present themselves and try to pass off that they are simple travelers and their boat capsized in the night , but the ruse does n't work , and the sentries demand that they drop their weapons so they can be taken prisoner and their identities confirmed . <entity id=10009>Bronn</entity> plants his sword in the sand - then quickly throws his dagger in the lead sentry 's throat . <entity id=10010>Jaime</entity> and <entity id=10011>Bronn</entity> draw their swords and fight the rest . <entity id=10012>Jaime</entity> ca n't fight very well left-handed so <entity id=10013>Bronn</entity> kills one sentry 's horse in order for Jaime to fight him on foot . <entity id=10014>Jaime</entity> is being overpowered but catches the sentry 's sword with his metal hand at the last moment . He then uses the distraction to land a killing blow to the sentry with his left hand . <entity id=10015>Bronn</entity> , having finished off the other sentries , notes that they now have their horses : fine <entity id=10016>Dornish</entity> sand steeds , capable of running a day and a night without tiring . <entity id=10017>Jaime</entity> says the bodies need to be buried so they wo n't raise more questions . <entity id=10018>Bronn</entity> says it will take a lot of time to dig holes for them all , though <entity id=10019>Jaime</entity> again points out that he ca n't really do much digging with one hand . <entity id=10020>Annoyed</entity> , <entity id=10021>Bronn</entity> then drags off the bodies to bury . The <entity id=10022>Sand Snakes</entity> torture a merchant ship captain . Meanwhile , elsewhere outside of <entity id=10023>Sunspear</entity> , <entity id=10024>Ellaria Sand</entity> meets with three of the eight <entity id=10025>Sand Snakes</entity> , her lover <entity id=10026>Oberyn Martell</entity> 's bastard daughters . <entity id=10027>Obara Obara</entity> , the eldest , is the daughter of a peasant ; <entity id=10028>Nymeria Sand</entity> ( commonly called `` Nym '' ) is the daughter of an eastern noblewoman ; the youngest of the three , <entity id=10029>Tyene Sand</entity> , is <entity id=10030>Ellaria</entity> 's own daughter . She informs them that <entity id=10031>Prince Doran Martell</entity> will not raise <entity id=10032>Dorne</entity> 's armies to avenge his brother 's death . They worry that they have no army to march against the <entity id=10033>Lannisters</entity> , but <entity id=10034>Ellaria</entity> tells them that they do n't need one : to start a war , all they need to do is kill <entity id=10035>Cersei</entity> 's daughter <entity id=10036>Myrcella</entity> , currently in <entity id=10037>Doran</entity> 's possession . <entity id=10038>Obara</entity> then points out that they may have a problem . The <entity id=10039>Pentoshi</entity> ship captain found her in <entity id=10040>Planky Town</entity> , and as <entity id=10041>Bronn</entity> feared , he indeed tried to sell her information about <entity id=10042>Jaime Lannister</entity> 's arrival in <entity id=10043>Dorne</entity> . The <entity id=10044>Sand Snakes</entity> , however , were insulted that he wanted to be paid for such vital information instead of offering it freely , so they took him prisoner and tortured it out of him . <entity id=10045>Nymeria</entity> uses her whip to knock a bucket over , and reveals underneath that they buried the ship 's captain neck-deep in the sand , with his head under a bucket full of poisonous scorpions . They realize that they are now in a race against time to see who can take Myrcella from <entity id=10046>Doran</entity> first : <entity id=10047>Jaime Lannister</entity> or themselves . <entity id=10048>Ellaria</entity> asks if the three girls are with her , knowing this will bring <entity id=10049>Dorne</entity> into war . <entity id=10050>Nymeria</entity> and <entity id=10051>Tyene</entity> say yes . <entity id=10052>Obara</entity> notes that when she first met <entity id=10053>Oberyn</entity> , he was a man whom she had never met who one day appeared , said he was her father , and that he was taking her away from her mother . Her mother wept , but <entity id=10054>Oberyn</entity> said that , `` we all must choose our battles and the gods let us choose our weapons . '' He threw his spear at her feet , pointed to her mother 's tears , then to his spear , and told her to choose . She chose the spear - and answers Ellaria that she is with her , as she chose the path of the spear and war long ago . She then throws her spear to impale the ship captain 's head . In the <entity id=10055>Free Cities</entity> . <entity id=10056>Tyrion</entity> is held captive by <entity id=10057>Jorah</entity> . At <entity id=10058>Volantis</entity> , during the night , <entity id=10059>Jorah Mormont</entity> knocks out a fisherman and steals his boat , leaving with his captive Tyrion Lannister . Later when they are at sea , <entity id=10060>Tyrion</entity> urges for <entity id=10061>Jorah</entity> to remove his gag . <entity id=10062>Jorah</entity> will not volunteer any information about himself , but from a few observations ( such as the bear sigil on his armor ) , <entity id=10063>Tyrion</entity> quickly surmises that he must be <entity id=10064>Jorah Mormont</entity> . He admits to Tyrion that the `` Queen '' he is taking him to is not Cersei but <entity id=10065>Daenerys</entity> . <entity id=10066>Tyrion</entity> recalls from <entity id=10067>Small Council</entity> meetings that <entity id=10068>Jorah</entity> was spying on <entity id=10069>Daenerys</entity> for <entity id=10070>Varys</entity> . Given that he is half the world away from <entity id=10071>Daenerys</entity> , he also accurately deduces that she must have found out he was spying on her and had him exiled - and therefore , he kidnapped Tyrion in the hope that presenting him as a gift to <entity id=10071>Daenerys</entity> will get him back in her favor . <entity id=10072>Tyrion</entity> laughs aloud at his situation , informing <entity id=10073>Jorah</entity> that he was already heading to meet <entity id=10074>Daenerys</entity> , so this is a waste of a kidnapping . <entity id=10075>Tyrion</entity> also points out that there is no guarantee this will assuage <entity id=10076>Daenerys</entity> , and it is just as likely she will remain angry at <entity id=10077>Jorah</entity> , and welcome himself as an ally . <entity id=10078>Jorah</entity> smacks <entity id=10079>Tyrion</entity> across the face , quieting him down . At the <entity id=10080>Wall</entity> . <entity id=10081>Melisandre</entity> seduces <entity id=10082>Jon</entity> . <entity id=10083>Jon Jon</entity> trains recruits in the practice yard of <entity id=10084>Castle Black</entity> , as <entity id=10085>Stannis Baratheon</entity> and his wife <entity id=10086>Selyse</entity> watch , along with their daughter <entity id=10087>Shireen</entity> . <entity id=10088>Selyse</entity> is worried that <entity id=10089>Stannis</entity> wishes <entity id=10090>Jon</entity> was his son , because she gave him only stillbirths and weakness , but he says that was n't her fault . <entity id=10091>Melisandre</entity> joins them and appears to quite firmly take <entity id=10092>Stannis</entity> 's side , declaring that the <entity id=10093>Lord</entity> of <entity id=10094>Light</entity> does n't care about <entity id=10095>Shireen</entity> 's <entity id=10096>Greyscale</entity> disfigurement , and this does n't change the fact that she has her father 's blood . When <entity id=10097>Selyse</entity> departs , <entity id=10098>Melisandre</entity> discusses the coming battle to take <entity id=10099>Winterfell</entity> from the <entity id=10100>Boltons</entity> . She asks if <entity id=10101>Stannis</entity> intends to leave her behind as he did at the <entity id=10102>Blackwater</entity> , but <entity id=10101>Stannis</entity> assures her he wo n't this time . As the new Lord Commander , <entity id=10103>Jon</entity> goes over paperwork with <entity id=10104>Samwell Tarly</entity> , letters they have received from minor Houses offering up a handful of new recruits . <entity id=10105>Jon</entity> balks when <entity id=10106>Samwell</entity> hands him a request letter for <entity id=10107>Roose Bolton</entity> , saying he killed his brother <entity id=10108>Robb</entity> . <entity id=10109>Sam</entity> points out that <entity id=10110>Roose Bolton</entity> is now the <entity id=10111>Warden</entity> of the <entity id=10112>North</entity> , and he has the most recruits to send them - much more than the pittances offered by the other minor <entity id=10113>Houses Jon</entity> has never even heard of . He reminds <entity id=10114>Jon</entity> that the <entity id=10115>Night's Watch</entity> has sworn an oath of political neutrality . With disgust , <entity id=10116>Jon</entity> reluctantly signs the letter to the <entity id=10117>Boltons</entity> . As <entity id=10118>Sam</entity> departs , <entity id=10119>Melisandre</entity> enters . She entreats him to assist <entity id=10120>Stannis</entity> in retaking <entity id=10121>Winterfell</entity> , pointing out that even if he does n't become a Stark , his familiarity with the castle could win them the battle . She also acknowledges that there is a greater war at stake , and asks <entity id=10122>Jon</entity> if he is on the side of life or death , undoing her dress and straddling him as she does so . She encourages <entity id=10123>Snow</entity> to take her , as the <entity id=10124>Lord</entity> of <entity id=10125>Light</entity> made humans male and female for a reason ; although clearly tempted , <entity id=10126>Jon</entity> refuses , citing his vows , and the fact that <entity id=10127>Stannis</entity> would n't approve ( to which <entity id=10128>Melisandre</entity> suggests they not tell him ) . When <entity id=10129>Melisandre</entity> points out that he broke his vows once before , <entity id=10130>Snow</entity> acknowledges that he still feels for his deceased love . <entity id=10131>Melisandre</entity> adjusts her dress and leaves , but not before uttering the words the new Lord Commander thought he 'd never hear again : `` You know nothing , <entity id=10132>Jon Snow</entity> . `` . Later , <entity id=10133>Stannis</entity> is in his chambers at <entity id=10134>Castle Black</entity> working on other letters , and <entity id=10135>Shireen</entity> enters . <entity id=10136>Stannis</entity> begins to apologise for dragging her along on campaign with him , as <entity id=10137>Castle Black</entity> is hardly a place for a child , but <entity id=10138>Shireen</entity> cuts him off ; she is happy to have come , having expected to be left at <entity id=10139>Dragonstone</entity> , as <entity id=10140>Selyse</entity> had made it clear she wanted . <entity id=10141>Shireen</entity> asks her father if he is ashamed of her because of her deformity ; <entity id=10142>Stannis</entity> gets up from his table and explains that not long after <entity id=10141>Shireen</entity> was born , a <entity id=10143>Dornish</entity> trader arrived on Dragonstone and , having heard of <entity id=10141>Shireen</entity> 's birth , gave a wooden doll as a gift for the newborn girl . Unfortunately , the doll was contaminated with greyscale , and by the time that was discovered , <entity id=10144>Shireen</entity> had already contracted the disease . Everyone claimed <entity id=10145>Shireen</entity> would die of it sooner or later , and urged <entity id=10146>Stannis</entity> to send her to the ruins of <entity id=10147>Valyria</entity> to live out her days with the `` Stone Men '' before the disease infected the rest of the castle ; <entity id=10146>Stannis</entity> says he told them all to go to hell and summoned every healer , apothecary and Maester he could to save <entity id=10145>Shireen</entity> . <entity id=10148>Stannis</entity> insists that <entity id=10149>Shireen</entity> is his daughter and he would not send her away because she belonged with her family . <entity id=10150>Shireen</entity> , overjoyed at her father 's declaration , runs over and gives him a hug which , after an awkward pause , <entity id=10151>Stannis</entity> returns . In the <entity id=10152>North</entity> . <entity id=10153>Sansa</entity> visits the tombs of her family . At <entity id=10154>Winterfell</entity> , <entity id=10155>Sansa Stark</entity> takes the opportunity to visit her family 's underground crypts . She comes to the tomb and statue of her aunt <entity id=10156>Lyanna Stark</entity> ( and finds the feather token that <entity id=10157>Robert Baratheon</entity> left there years ago when he visited the castle ) . <entity id=10158>Petyr Petyr</entity> arrives and says he thought he 'd find her there . <entity id=10159>Sansa</entity> remarks that her father , <entity id=10160>Eddard Stark</entity> , never talked about <entity id=10161>Lyanna</entity> , but she would at times find him down in the crypts lighting candles at her tomb . <entity id=10162>Sansa</entity> never knew <entity id=10163>Lyanna</entity> because she died before she was born , but she notes that people say she was beautiful . <entity id=10164>Littlefinger</entity> says that he actually saw <entity id=10165>Lyanna</entity> once years ago , and she was as beautiful as everyone says . Back when he was a boy living with <entity id=10166>Sansa</entity> 's mother 's family , the old <entity id=10167>Lord Whent</entity> of <entity id=10168>Harrenhal</entity> held a massive tournament : every notable figure of the time came from across Westeros : the <entity id=10169>Mad King</entity> , <entity id=10170>Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen</entity> , <entity id=10171>Robert Baratheon</entity> , <entity id=10172>Lyanna Stark</entity> , everyone . <entity id=10173>Lyanna</entity> had already been publicly betrothed to <entity id=10174>Robert</entity> at the time . <entity id=10175>Baelish</entity> remembers how awed he was , a boy from nowhere and with no significant holdings , to see all of these living legends gathered in one place . In the final tilt , <entity id=10176>Prince Rhaegar</entity> rode against <entity id=10177>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> . <entity id=10178>Rhaegar</entity> won and the entire crowd erupted in cheers - only to suddenly drop dead silent when <entity id=10178>Rhaegar</entity> rode right past his wife , <entity id=10179>Elia Martell</entity> , to lay the victor 's crown ( made of blue winter roses ) in <entity id=10180>Lyanna</entity> 's lap . Not long afterwards , <entity id=10181>Rhaegar</entity> made off with <entity id=10182>Lyanna</entity> , sparking off <entity id=10183>Robert</entity> 's Rebellion which overthrew the <entity id=10184>Targaryen</entity> dynasty . <entity id=10185>Littlefinger</entity> wonders how many thousands died because <entity id=10186>Rhaegar</entity> chose <entity id=10187>Lyanna</entity> - to which <entity id=10188>Sansa</entity> says that he chose her , then kidnapped and raped her . <entity id=10189>Baelish</entity> gives her a wry look and moves on to another part of the crypts . <entity id=10190>Sansa</entity> notices that <entity id=10191>Littlefinger</entity> is wearing riding clothes , and he explains that he is heading back to <entity id=10192>King</entity> 's Landing , because <entity id=10193>Cersei</entity> sent a letter requesting his presence and it would be best not to make her suspicious by refusing to come . <entity id=10194>Sansa</entity> will be alone with the Boltons but he explains his plan to her : <entity id=10195>Stannis</entity> will have to attack the <entity id=10196>Boltons</entity> soon if he is to beat the winter snows , and he bets that <entity id=10195>Stannis</entity> will probably win , because he is one of the best military commanders in all of <entity id=10197>Westeros</entity> , and the <entity id=10196>Boltons</entity> will be outnumbered by <entity id=10195>Stannis</entity> , as the other northern houses would be quick to betray their liege lord . <entity id=10198>Stannis</entity> will then make <entity id=10199>Sansa</entity> the new ruler of the <entity id=10200>North</entity> , as the last ( known ) surviving <entity id=10201>Stark</entity> heir and in memory of her father <entity id=10202>Eddard</entity> 's support for <entity id=10198>Stannis</entity> . <entity id=10203>Sansa</entity> asks what will happen on the off chance that <entity id=10204>Stannis</entity> gets killed , and <entity id=10205>Littlefinger</entity> explains that marrying <entity id=10206>Ramsay Bolton</entity> now will at least leave <entity id=10203>Sansa</entity> in a position to insinuate herself among the <entity id=10207>Boltons</entity> and help destroy them from within in future plans . Either way , <entity id=10208>Sansa</entity> will be <entity id=10209>Littlefinger</entity> 's powerful `` ally '' in the <entity id=10210>North</entity> . <entity id=10211>Littlefinger</entity> kisses <entity id=10212>Sansa</entity> on the lips , and departs . In <entity id=10213>Meereen</entity> . <entity id=10214>Dany</entity> speaks with <entity id=10215>Ser Barristan</entity> . In <entity id=10216>Meereen</entity> , <entity id=10217>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> is looking down on the streets below from her royal apartments in the <entity id=10218>Great Pyramid</entity> , and <entity id=10219>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> also brings up <entity id=10220>Rhaegar Targaryen</entity> . He says that the city 's inhabitants always seem happy from such a distance , but <entity id=10221>Rhaegar</entity> actually liked to leave the <entity id=10222>Red Keep</entity> and mingle with the common people on the streets . <entity id=10223>Barristan</entity> accompanied him often to guard him , and says that <entity id=10224>Rhaegar</entity> liked to sing to people . He was a great singer , so he would find a place on one of the streets just like any public minstrel and sing . He liked to see how much money he could make , and everyone enjoyed his singing , so he often made quite a lot . <entity id=10225>Daenerys</entity> is surprised , because her brother <entity id=10226>Viserys</entity> only told her that <entity id=10227>Rhaegar</entity> was a great killer . An injured <entity id=10228>Grey Worm</entity> continues to fight the <entity id=10229>Sons</entity> of the <entity id=10230>Harpy</entity> . <entity id=10231>Barristan</entity> scoffs that <entity id=10232>Rhaegar</entity> was a great warrior but never enjoyed killing , he was a gentle man who enjoyed singing . She asks what they did with all the money , and <entity id=10233>Barristan</entity> says that they did all sorts of things : sometimes they just gave it to the next minstrel on the road , once <entity id=10234>Rhaegar</entity> gave it all to an orphanage in the slums of <entity id=10235>Flea Bottom</entity> , and one time they spent it to get horribly drunk . <entity id=10236>Daario Daario</entity> then comes to say that the day 's supplicants are waiting in the throne room , chief among them Hizdahr zo <entity id=10237>Loraq</entity> . Aware of his dislike of politics , <entity id=10238>Daenerys</entity> asks if <entity id=10239>Barristan</entity> wants to attend her in the throne room ; after being assured that <entity id=10240>Daario</entity> has her back , she gives him the day off , cheerfully telling him to make some music in the city below . <entity id=10241>Hizdahr</entity> again beseeches <entity id=10242>Daenerys</entity> to reopen the fighting pits of <entity id=10243>Meereen</entity> , because today is the traditional beginning of the fighting season . <entity id=10244>Daenerys</entity> again refuses , but <entity id=10245>Hizdahr</entity> rationally argues that the fighting pits provide a great spectacle that has always been enjoyed by both the slave-masters and slaves , and is one of the few things that can bring the city together . Bringing back this major tradition will not instantly solve all of her problems , he concedes , but it would be a start at mending together her subjects . <entity id=10246>Barristan</entity> runs towards danger . As he speaks , the <entity id=10247>Sons</entity> of the <entity id=10248>Harpy</entity> are already mounting a series of large-scale attacks in the streets . A <entity id=10249>Meereenese</entity> prostitute helps them distract and kill some of the <entity id=10250>Second Sons</entity> , and when a patrol of <entity id=10251>Unsullied</entity> arrives , she feigns fear and directs them into a trap by pointing that the <entity id=10252>Sons</entity> of the <entity id=10253>Harpy</entity> ran into a narrow alleyway . The <entity id=10254>Unsullied</entity> give chase , only to be surrounded by a much larger number of the <entity id=10255>Sons</entity> of the <entity id=10256>Harpy</entity> . <entity id=10257>Brutal</entity> fighting rages throughout the streets of <entity id=10258>Meereen</entity> . <entity id=10259>Grey Grey</entity> is among the ambushed <entity id=10260>Unsullied</entity> ; he kills many attackers , though he loses his helmet , is slashed in the leg , and is stabbed in his side . <entity id=10261>Grey Grey</entity> pulls the dagger out of himself , stabs a foe in the throat with it , and keeps fighting , though his wounds slow him considerably . Most of the <entity id=10262>Sons</entity> of the <entity id=10263>Harpy</entity> are dead but they outnumber the Unsullied so much to begin with that only <entity id=10264>Grey Worm</entity> is left . Just then , <entity id=10265>Ser Barristan</entity> arrives and saves <entity id=10266>Grey Worm</entity> by drawing the attention of the remaining rebels . He takes on eight Sons of the <entity id=10267>Harpy</entity> and defeats them all , save for the last one , who stabs him in the belly . He falls to his knees and just as his attacker is about to slit his throat , <entity id=10268>Grey Worm</entity> takes him out by shoving his spear into his back . <entity id=10269>Grey Grey</entity> staggers over <entity id=10270>Barristan</entity> , but he has lost consciousness . Severely wounded , <entity id=10271>Grey Worm</entity> then slumps down to the floor next to him .
