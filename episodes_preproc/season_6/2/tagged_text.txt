<entity class="NE" id=11919>Bran</entity> trains with the Three-Eyed Raven . In <entity class="NE" id=11920>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=11921>Jaime</entity> advises <entity class="NE" id=11922>Tommen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11923>Tyrion</entity> demands good news , but has to make his own . At <entity class="NE" id=11924>Castle Black</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=11925>Night's Watch</entity> stands behind <entity class="NE" id=11926>Thorne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11927>Ramsay Ramsay</entity> proposes a plan , and <entity class="NE" id=11928>Balon Greyjoy</entity> entertains other proposals . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=11929>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11930>Bran Bran</entity> continues his training under the Three-Eyed Raven at the tree . He is shown a scene from <entity class="NE" id=11931>Winterfell</entity> , watching his father and <entity class="NE" id=11932>Uncle Benjen</entity> training in the yard as young boys . He also sees his <entity class="NE" id=11933>Aunt Lyanna</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11934>Old Nan</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=11935>Ser Rodrik Cassel</entity> . He also sees a stableboy that he realizes is a young <entity class="NE" id=11936>Hodor</entity> - and is surprised that in his youth he was not a lackwit but was intellectually normal and could talk , and his real name is actually `` Wylis '' . Though <entity class="NE" id=11937>Bran</entity> wants to stay , he is dragged out of the vision by the Three-Eyed Raven , who warns him that it is dangerous to stay too long in such visions . Outside the tree , <entity class="NE" id=11938>Bran</entity> finds <entity class="NE" id=11939>Meera Reed</entity> , who still appears to be in mourning over her brother 's death . Though <entity class="NE" id=11940>Meera</entity> questions the point of her presence during <entity class="NE" id=11941>Bran</entity> 's training , <entity class="NE" id=11942>Leaf</entity> states that <entity class="NE" id=11941>Bran</entity> will need her when he leaves the tree . At <entity class="NE" id=11943>King</entity> 's Landing . In a tavern , a man drunkenly boasts of having taunted <entity class="NE" id=11944>Cersei</entity> during her walk of atonement to the great amusement of the other patrons . After he finishes his story , he leaves the tavern to urinate against a wall outside . As he is urinating , he is confronted by <entity class="NE" id=11945>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> , who kills him by smashing his head against the wall . <entity class="NE" id=11946>Ser Ser</entity> returns to <entity class="NE" id=11947>Cersei</entity> 's side following the murder . <entity class="NE" id=11948>Myrcella</entity> 's funeral is held at the <entity class="NE" id=11949>Great Sept</entity> of Baelor but <entity class="NE" id=11950>Cersei</entity> can not attend . <entity class="NE" id=11951>Tommen</entity> has ordered that <entity class="NE" id=11952>Cersei</entity> be confined to the <entity class="NE" id=11953>Red Keep</entity> since he is concerned that the <entity class="NE" id=11954>Faith Militant</entity> will re-arrest her if she steps inside the sept . In the sept , <entity class="NE" id=11955>Jaime</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11956>Tommen</entity> talk about <entity class="NE" id=11957>Myrcella</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11958>Prince Trystane</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11959>Tommen</entity> believes that <entity class="NE" id=11960>Cersei</entity> is to blame for <entity class="NE" id=11961>Prince Trystane</entity> 's death but tells Jaime that he is n't upset with her . <entity class="NE" id=11962>Jaime</entity> convinces <entity class="NE" id=11963>Tommen</entity> to go see his mother and apologize to her as the <entity class="NE" id=11964>High Sparrow</entity> enters the sept. After <entity class="NE" id=11963>Tommen</entity> leaves , <entity class="NE" id=11962>Jaime</entity> begins threatening the <entity class="NE" id=11964>High Sparrow</entity> and asks him why <entity class="NE" id=11965>Cersei</entity> is being punished for her sins , but he is n't , considering he murdered the king he vowed to protect . As <entity class="NE" id=11966>Jaime</entity> is about to kill the <entity class="NE" id=11967>High Sparrow</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=11967>High Sparrow</entity> seems to be unafraid to die , which confuses <entity class="NE" id=11966>Jaime</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=11968>High Sparrow</entity> explains that if <entity class="NE" id=11969>Jaime</entity> chooses to kill him then many of the sparrows will die fighting him , but it would n't really matter since they have no names or individual power . He says that they mean nothing individually , but together they can overthrow an empire . <entity class="NE" id=11970>Tommen</entity> visits <entity class="NE" id=11971>Cersei</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=11972>Red Keep</entity> and apologizes for not being more assertive during her imprisonment . He regrets letting the <entity class="NE" id=11973>High Sparrow</entity> lock her away and says that he should have torn the sept down with the <entity class="NE" id=11973>High Sparrow</entity> inside of it . He tells her that he needs her help in being a strong ruler . <entity class="NE" id=11974>Cersei</entity> remains uncharacteristically silent throughout the exchange , but when <entity class="NE" id=11975>Tommen</entity> is done speaking , she embraces him . In <entity class="NE" id=11976>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11977>Missandei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11978>Grey Worm</entity> tell Tyrion that <entity class="NE" id=11979>Rhaegal</entity> and Viserion have not been eating ever since <entity class="NE" id=11980>Daenerys</entity> left . <entity class="NE" id=11981>Tyrion</entity> explains that dragons do not do well in captivity and they will probably start eating again if they are unchained . He also suggests that dragons are intelligent enough to remember their friends , and that they will probably not harm <entity class="NE" id=11982>Missandei</entity> if they meet her again , since she spent so much time with them when they were little . <entity class="NE" id=11983>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11984>Varys</entity> go down below the pyramid , with <entity class="NE" id=11983>Tyrion</entity> advancing into the darkness alone . One of the dragons emerges from the shadows and <entity class="NE" id=11985>Tyrion</entity> maintains eye contact . When the other emerges , <entity class="NE" id=11986>Tyrion</entity> puts down his torch and gently advances . To calm them , <entity class="NE" id=11987>Tyrion</entity> speaks gently , explaining that some say that dragons are more intelligent than humans , and tells about about a time when he was little and had asked his uncle for a dragon â€“ not even a large one , just a little one like him . They all laughed , then <entity class="NE" id=11988>Tyrion</entity> 's father told him dragons were extinct , and <entity class="NE" id=11988>Tyrion</entity> says he cried himself to sleep that night . At this point , <entity class="NE" id=11989>Tyrion</entity> is finally close enough to release the locking pin on the second dragon 's collar . The other advances on him , then gingerly turns his head to the side so <entity class="NE" id=11990>Tyrion</entity> can free him as well . The dragons retreat , and <entity class="NE" id=11991>Tyrion</entity> hastily returns to <entity class="NE" id=11992>Varys</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11993>Tyrion</entity> instructs <entity class="NE" id=11994>Varys</entity> to punch him if he ever suggests doing anything like that again . In <entity class="NE" id=11995>Braavos</entity> . Still a beggar on the streets , <entity class="NE" id=11996>Arya</entity> is again approached by the <entity class="NE" id=11997>Waif</entity> , who asks her name . <entity class="NE" id=11998>Arya</entity> says she is `` no one '' , at which the <entity class="NE" id=11999>Waif</entity> hits her . The <entity class="NE" id=12000>Waif</entity> retorts that she does n't believe that and neither does <entity class="NE" id=12001>Arya</entity> . She tries to fight back , but the <entity class="NE" id=12002>Waif</entity> vanishes , replaced with <entity class="NE" id=12003>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> . He promises that if she says her name , <entity class="NE" id=12004>Arya</entity> will sleep under a roof that night , that she will eat , and he will restore her eyes . Each time however <entity class="NE" id=12005>Arya</entity> says she has no name . <entity class="NE" id=12006>Satisfied</entity> , he tells <entity class="NE" id=12007>Arya</entity> to follow him , and that she is a beggar no more . In the <entity class="NE" id=12008>North</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=12009>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12010>Ramsay</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12011>Roose</entity> discuss plans with <entity class="NE" id=12012>Harald Karstark</entity> regarding what to do about <entity class="NE" id=12013>Sansa</entity> . After <entity class="NE" id=12014>Ramsay</entity> suggests storming <entity class="NE" id=12015>Castle Black</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12016>Roose</entity> warns <entity class="NE" id=12014>Ramsay</entity> that such an action would turn the entire <entity class="NE" id=12017>North</entity> against <entity class="HSE" id=12018>House Bolton</entity> , adding that if he does not act more sensibly he will be discarded . At that point , <entity class="NE" id=12019>Maester Wolkan</entity> enters and announces that <entity class="NE" id=12020>Roose</entity> 's wife , <entity class="NE" id=12021>Walda</entity> , has given birth to a baby boy . <entity class="NE" id=12022>Ramsay</entity> , realizing that his position is weaker than ever , stabs his father to death and , in his position as the new Lord <entity class="NE" id=12023>Bolton</entity> , he personally feeds <entity class="NE" id=12024>Walda</entity> and his half-brother to the hounds . In the woods , <entity class="NE" id=12025>Brienne</entity> fills <entity class="NE" id=12026>Sansa</entity> in on her encounter with <entity class="NE" id=12027>Arya</entity> , whilst <entity class="NE" id=12026>Sansa</entity> is reluctant to talk about her experiences under <entity class="NE" id=12028>Ramsay Bolton</entity> 's tyranny at <entity class="NE" id=12029>Winterfell</entity> . She admits that she ought to have accepted her help sooner . Then Theon , wracked with guilt over his betrayal of the <entity class="NE" id=12030>Stark</entity> family , decides to leave the group and go home . He tells <entity class="NE" id=12031>Sansa</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=12032>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12033>Pod</entity> will do a better job of looking after her , though he tearfully states that he would have gone with her all the way to <entity class="NE" id=12034>Castle Black</entity> if necessary . He asks to take one of the horses with him , and the two share an embrace . In the <entity class="NE" id=12035>Iron Islands</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=12036>Pyke</entity> , it is a dark and stormy night . <entity class="NE" id=12037>Yara Yara</entity> reads a letter to King <entity class="NE" id=12038>Balon Greyjoy</entity> about how Glovers retook <entity class="NE" id=12039>Deepwood Motte</entity> and killed all of the Ironborn who held the castle . <entity class="NE" id=12040>Yara</entity> notes that their invasion is now a definite failure since <entity class="NE" id=12041>Deepwood Motte</entity> was the last stronghold that the <entity class="NE" id=12042>Ironborn</entity> held in the <entity class="NE" id=12043>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12044>Balon</entity> tells her that they will continue fighting , but <entity class="NE" id=12045>Yara</entity> argues that invading the <entity class="NE" id=12046>North</entity> is pointless since they are unable to hold the strongholds they conquer against the mainland armies and the strongholds in the mainlands are n't really valuable to the <entity class="NE" id=12047>Ironborn</entity> because they are so far away from the sea . <entity class="NE" id=12048>Balon</entity> says that one of the reasons that the invasion was n't successful was because <entity class="NE" id=12049>Yara</entity> wasted men when she attempted to rescue Theon , which she says she will not apologize for . <entity class="NE" id=12050>Yara</entity> continues to try to convince <entity class="NE" id=12051>Balon</entity> to end the rebellion , saying the only reason they were able to take strongholds in the <entity class="NE" id=12052>North</entity> in the first place was because the <entity class="NE" id=12053>Northerners</entity> were in the south fighting a war , and now that war is over . She reminds <entity class="NE" id=12054>Balon</entity> that the last time they provoked the <entity class="NE" id=12055>Northerners</entity> too far they were crushed and her two oldest brothers were killed . <entity class="NE" id=12056>Balon</entity> tells her that when she rules she can be content with their current standing , but for now she needs to obey his commands or he will make another heir who will . <entity class="NE" id=12057>Balon</entity> starts walking on the swinging rope bridge that separates two of the towers of <entity class="NE" id=12058>Pyke</entity> . Through the storm , he sees a man standing on the bridge who is blocking his way . He tells the man to get out of the way , but the man reveals himself to be <entity class="NE" id=12059>Balon</entity> 's younger brother , <entity class="NE" id=12060>Euron Greyjoy</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12061>Balon</entity> tells him that he 's surprised that he 's still alive , and <entity class="NE" id=12062>Euron</entity> mocks the <entity class="NE" id=12063>Drowned God</entity> , telling <entity class="NE" id=12061>Balon</entity> that he is the <entity class="NE" id=12063>Drowned God</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12064>Balon</entity> explains that he heard a rumor that <entity class="NE" id=12065>Euron</entity> lost his senses during a storm and his crew had to tie him to the mast of the ship to prevent him from jumping overboard . <entity class="NE" id=12066>Euron</entity> does n't deny the rumor , and explains to Balon that he cut the tongues out of all of his crew members because he wanted silence . <entity class="NE" id=12067>Euron</entity> then says that <entity class="NE" id=12068>Balon</entity> is too old to rule and that he 's been ruling long enough and it 's someone else 's turn . <entity class="NE" id=12069>Balon</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=12070>Euron</entity> that he is n't a true Ironborn because he lost his wits during a thunderstorm and tries to stab him , but <entity class="NE" id=12070>Euron</entity> throws him off the rope bridge to his death . At <entity class="NE" id=12071>Balon</entity> 's funeral , <entity class="NE" id=12072>Yara</entity> tells the priest , <entity class="NE" id=12073>Aeron Greyjoy</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12071>Balon</entity> 's youngest brother , that she will find the person who did this and feed them to sharks while they 're still alive . She swears to do this upon the <entity class="NE" id=12074>Salt Throne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12075>Aeron</entity> explains to her that she is n't the ruler yet , because the law says that the <entity class="NE" id=12076>Kingsmoot</entity> chooses the next ruler . <entity class="NE" id=12077>Yara</entity> argues that her father wanted her to rule , but <entity class="NE" id=12078>Aeron</entity> says that he does n't make the law . At the <entity class="NE" id=12079>Wall</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=12080>Castle Black</entity> , nightfall has arrived and the band of black brothers loyal to <entity class="NE" id=12081>Jon</entity> have not yet surrendered . When <entity class="NE" id=12082>Davos</entity> refuses a final ultimatum from <entity class="NE" id=12083>Ser Alliser Thorne</entity> , the acting <entity class="NE" id=12084>Lord Commander</entity> orders the door to be battered down with a sledgehammer . Before the mutineers can break in , however , <entity class="NE" id=12085>Edd</entity> returns with <entity class="NE" id=12086>Tormund Giantsbane</entity> and an army of wildlings . Though <entity class="NE" id=12087>Thorne</entity> demands that the watchmen stand and fight , they are intimidated into surrender by the giant , <entity class="NE" id=12088>Wun Wun</entity> , enabling an almost bloodless takeover . One archer shoots an arrow into <entity class="NE" id=12089>Wun Wun</entity> 's back , which has no effect upon the giant other than to cause <entity class="NE" id=12089>Wun Wun</entity> to grab the archer off his perch and smash his skull against a wall . The watchmen , seeing this , quickly throw down their arms and surrender . No wildlings are hurt . <entity class="NE" id=12090>Thorne</entity> , plus Olly and the officers who mutinied alongside him , are led away to the <entity class="NE" id=12091>Ice Cells</entity> . As <entity class="NE" id=12092>Tormund</entity> inspects <entity class="NE" id=12093>Jon</entity> 's corpse , <entity class="NE" id=12094>Davos</entity> visits <entity class="NE" id=12095>Melisandre</entity> , who has donned her normal glamor but is still gripped by a crisis of faith . When he asks her if reviving <entity class="NE" id=12096>Jon</entity> is possible , she admits to having seen it done , but insists that she can not do it , having lost faith in the <entity class="NE" id=12097>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=12098>Light</entity> due to the failure of her predictions regarding <entity class="NE" id=12099>Stannis Baratheon</entity> to come true . After <entity class="NE" id=12100>Davos</entity> implores her simply to try , she agrees . After washing <entity class="NE" id=12101>Jon</entity> 's wounds clean and burning his hair , she attempts to revive him using murmured <entity class="NE" id=12102>High Valyrian</entity> incantations , but it seems they have no effect . After a moment , <entity class="NE" id=12103>Tormund</entity> leaves , and <entity class="NE" id=12104>Melisandre</entity> offers a final `` please '' in the <entity class="NE" id=12105>Common Tongue</entity> , but leaves the room , despondent . <entity class="NE" id=12106>Edd</entity> and finally <entity class="NE" id=12107>Davos</entity> follow her a moment later . Once the room is empty however , <entity class="NE" id=12108>Ghost</entity> , who had been sleeping underneath the table upon which <entity class="NE" id=12109>Jon</entity> was lying , perks up , and <entity class="NE" id=12109>Jon</entity> suddenly awakens , gasping for air .
