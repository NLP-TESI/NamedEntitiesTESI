<entity class="NE" id=12395>Tyrion</entity> strikes a deal . <entity class="NE" id=12396>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12397>Daario</entity> undertake a difficult task . <entity class="NE" id=12398>Jaime</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12399>Cersei</entity> try to improve their situation . <entity class="NE" id=12400>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12401>Sansa</entity> reunite . Summary . In <entity class="NE" id=12402>King</entity> 's Landing . Underneath the <entity class="NE" id=12403>Great Sept</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=12404>Baelor</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12405>Septa Unella</entity> enters <entity class="NE" id=12406>Queen Margaery Tyrell</entity> 's cell and leads her to a private meeting with the <entity class="NE" id=12407>High Sparrow</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=12408>High Sparrow</entity> asks her what she would do if he allowed her to leave that day . <entity class="NE" id=12409>Margaery</entity> replied that she wants to return to her family and her husband <entity class="NE" id=12410>Tommen Baratheon</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=12411>High Sparrow</entity> respects her love for her family but tells her that attachment leads to sin , citing his experience as a cobbler . <entity class="NE" id=12412>Margaery</entity> manages to impress the <entity class="NE" id=12413>Sparrow</entity> with her knowledge of The <entity class="NE" id=12414>Book</entity> of the Stranger , which she admits <entity class="NE" id=12415>Septa Unella</entity> had read at her . The <entity class="NE" id=12416>High Sparrow</entity> chuckles and agrees that <entity class="NE" id=12417>Unella</entity> has a habit of reading at people instead of to them . The <entity class="NE" id=12418>High Sparrow</entity> recounts how in his youth he was a womanizer and drunkard . He underwent a conversion experience the morning after an orgy , as his drunken guests lay naked all around his house . Tired of what he was now perceiving as a meaningless existence , the <entity class="NE" id=12419>High Sparrow</entity> then turned his life around and became a devoted member of the <entity class="NE" id=12420>Faith</entity> of the Seven . He then left his job as a cobbler and devoted his life to the poor and destitute . Believing he has found a way to reach <entity class="NE" id=12421>Margaery</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=12422>Sparrow</entity> allows her to visit her brother <entity class="NE" id=12423>Loras Tyrell</entity> . Margaery remaining in her cell . She finds a dejected Loras lying on the floor of his cell . <entity class="NE" id=12424>Loras</entity> has lost the will to continue resisting but <entity class="NE" id=12425>Margaery</entity> tells him to stay strong because he is the future of <entity class="HSE" id=12426>House Tyrell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12427>Loras</entity> tells them that he only wants his imprisonment to end and pleads with her to help him . <entity class="NE" id=12428>Margaery</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=12429>Loras</entity> that the <entity class="NE" id=12430>Sparrow</entity> is trying to use them to break each other and again tells him to stay strong . At the <entity class="NE" id=12431>Red Keep</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12432>Cersei Lannister</entity> walks in on <entity class="NE" id=12433>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> advising King <entity class="NE" id=12434>Tommen</entity> to accommodate the <entity class="NE" id=12435>High Sparrow</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=12436>Faith Militant</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12437>Cersei</entity> requests that <entity class="NE" id=12438>Pycelle</entity> leave the room while she talks to her son alone under the pretext of meeting him for updates about the previous <entity class="NE" id=12439>Small Council</entity> meetings . During their conversation , <entity class="NE" id=12440>Tommen</entity> proposes that the <entity class="NE" id=12441>Iron Throne</entity> not antagonize the <entity class="NE" id=12442>Sparrows</entity> further in order to avoid endangering <entity class="NE" id=12443>Margaery</entity> 's life . <entity class="NE" id=12444>Cersei</entity> then reminds her son about the humiliation that she endured at their hands and exploits <entity class="NE" id=12445>Tommen</entity> 's love for <entity class="NE" id=12446>Margaery</entity> . She convinces her son that the <entity class="NE" id=12447>High Sparrow</entity> has no respect for kings , queens , and society . Tommen then reveals a secret that the <entity class="NE" id=12448>High Sparrow</entity> shared with him . Armed with this new information , <entity class="NE" id=12449>Cersei</entity> barges into a <entity class="NE" id=12450>Small Council</entity> meeting between <entity class="NE" id=12451>Kevan Lannister</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12452>Olenna Tyrell</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=12453>Jaime Lannister</entity> . While <entity class="NE" id=12454>Kevan</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12455>Olenna</entity> are initially hostile , <entity class="NE" id=12456>Cersei</entity> convinces them to listen to her . She then informs the <entity class="NE" id=12457>Council</entity> that the <entity class="NE" id=12458>High Sparrow</entity> has planned to make <entity class="NE" id=12459>Margaery</entity> do the walk of atonement . <entity class="NE" id=12460>Olenna</entity> is horrified that the <entity class="NE" id=12461>Sparrows</entity> plan to debase her granddaughter . Jaime then urges the <entity class="NE" id=12462>Council</entity> to allow the <entity class="NE" id=12463>Tyrells</entity> to march their army into <entity class="NE" id=12464>King</entity> 's Landing , crush the <entity class="NE" id=12465>Faith Militant</entity> , and bring <entity class="NE" id=12466>Margaery</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12467>Loras</entity> back to the <entity class="NE" id=12468>Red Keep</entity> into <entity class="NE" id=12469>Crown</entity> custody . <entity class="NE" id=12470>Kevan</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=12471>Tommen</entity> expressly forbid him to use the <entity class="NE" id=12472>Lannister</entity> army he commands at the city to make a move against the <entity class="NE" id=12473>Great Sept</entity> , for fear that the <entity class="NE" id=12474>Faith Militant</entity> will harm <entity class="NE" id=12475>Margaery</entity> in retaliation . Jaime suggests that <entity class="NE" id=12476>Olenna</entity> send <entity class="HSE" id=12477>House Tyrell</entity> 's army to the city instead , and points out to his uncle that <entity class="NE" id=12478>Tommen</entity> only forbade his army from making a move - but he never expressly told him to prevent anyone else from trying , so <entity class="NE" id=12479>Kevan</entity> would n't be breaking any commands if his forces simply stand down when the <entity class="NE" id=12480>Tyrell</entity> army arrives . The <entity class="NE" id=12481>Tyrell</entity> army will surround the <entity class="NE" id=12482>Great Sept</entity> , intimidating the <entity class="NE" id=12483>Sparrows</entity> into releasing <entity class="NE" id=12484>Margaery</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12485>Loras</entity> , without any blood actually being shed - and by the time <entity class="NE" id=12486>Tommen</entity> finds out what they 've done he will already be happy with the outcome . <entity class="NE" id=12487>Kevan</entity> 's interest is now turned , but he still expresses reluctance should they fail . <entity class="NE" id=12488>Cersei</entity> is able to make him change his mind by exploiting his hatred towards the <entity class="NE" id=12489>Sparrows</entity> for taking his last remaining son and heir <entity class="NE" id=12490>Lancel Lannister</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12491>Olenna</entity> agrees that blood will be shed no matter what they do at this point , so it 's better if it 's the <entity class="NE" id=12492>Sparrows</entity> ' blood and not theirs . At the <entity class="NE" id=12493>Wall</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=12494>Castle Black</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12495>Eddison Tollett</entity> helps <entity class="NE" id=12496>Jon Snow</entity> pack up his things . <entity class="NE" id=12497>Edd</entity> scolds <entity class="NE" id=12498>Jon</entity> for leaving the <entity class="NE" id=12499>Night</entity> 's Watch after taking an oath , to which <entity class="NE" id=12498>Jon</entity> replies that he gave his life for the <entity class="NE" id=12500>Night's Watch</entity> and ca n't trust his brothers . At that moment , the horns sound for the arrival of travellers . <entity class="NE" id=12501>Sansa Sansa</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12502>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=12503>Tarth</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12504>Podrick Payne</entity> ride through the gates and dismount in the courtyard . <entity class="NE" id=12505>Jon</entity> rushes out and sees <entity class="NE" id=12506>Sansa</entity> for the first time since the <entity class="NE" id=12507>Starks</entity> left <entity class="NE" id=12508>Winterfell</entity> for King 's Landing , and they embrace . Later that night , they converse and reminisce on their childhood . <entity class="NE" id=12509>Sansa</entity> proposes they take <entity class="NE" id=12510>Winterfell</entity> back from <entity class="NE" id=12511>Ramsay Bolton</entity> but <entity class="NE" id=12512>Jon</entity> says he 's done fighting , especially after hanging Olly . <entity class="NE" id=12513>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12514>Sansa</entity> are reunited at the <entity class="NE" id=12515>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12516>Davos Davos</entity> asks whether <entity class="NE" id=12517>Melisandre</entity> will stay at <entity class="NE" id=12518>Castle Black</entity> and she replies she will do as <entity class="NE" id=12519>Jon Snow</entity> , The Prince That Was Promised , commands . <entity class="NE" id=12520>Davos</entity> asks what happened to <entity class="NE" id=12521>Stannis</entity> and she replies he was defeated in battle . When he asks about <entity class="NE" id=12522>Shireen</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12523>Melisandre</entity> is reluctant to speak . Their conversation is interrupted by <entity class="NE" id=12524>Brienne</entity> , who recognizes <entity class="NE" id=12525>Davos</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12526>Melisandre</entity> as <entity class="NE" id=12527>Stannis</entity> ' former entourage . Still bitter over the death of King <entity class="NE" id=12528>Renly Baratheon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12529>Brienne</entity> warns <entity class="NE" id=12530>Melisandre</entity> that she does not forget or forgive . She also tells them that she executed <entity class="NE" id=12531>Stannis</entity> after he admitted using blood magic to assassinate <entity class="NE" id=12532>Renly</entity> . Some time later , <entity class="NE" id=12533>Jon</entity> receives a letter from <entity class="NE" id=12534>Ramsay Bolton</entity> stating that he has <entity class="NE" id=12535>Rickon Stark</entity> at <entity class="NE" id=12536>Winterfell</entity> and if <entity class="NE" id=12537>Sansa</entity> is not returned , he will slaughter every Wildling at <entity class="NE" id=12538>Castle Black</entity> , let his men rape <entity class="NE" id=12537>Sansa</entity> , and feed <entity class="NE" id=12533>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12539>Rickon</entity> to his dogs . <entity class="NE" id=12540>Tormund</entity> says he has 2,000 able fighters , far less than the estimated 5,000 <entity class="NE" id=12541>Ramsay</entity> has . <entity class="NE" id=12542>Sansa</entity> says that they have to try to retake their home and rescue their brother and that the houses of the <entity class="NE" id=12543>North</entity> will unite behind <entity class="NE" id=12544>Jon</entity> as the son of the true Warden of the <entity class="NE" id=12543>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12545>Jon</entity> resolves to take <entity class="NE" id=12546>Ramsay</entity> down . In the <entity class="NE" id=12547>Vale</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12548>Robin</entity> practices his archery . At <entity class="NE" id=12549>Runestone</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12550>Robin Arryn</entity> trains at his archery in front of <entity class="NE" id=12551>Lord Yohn Royce</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12552>Petyr Petyr</entity> arrives with a retinue of <entity class="NE" id=12553>Arryn</entity> guards and a pet falcon as a belated name-day gift . <entity class="NE" id=12554>Royce</entity> reminds <entity class="NE" id=12555>Baelish</entity> that he told him that he was taking <entity class="NE" id=12556>Sansa</entity> with him to The <entity class="NE" id=12557>Fingers</entity> , but he received word that she had been married to <entity class="NE" id=12558>Ramsay Bolton</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12559>Baelish</entity> tells him that on the way to The Fingers they were set upon by a large force of <entity class="NE" id=12560>Bolton</entity> men . A confrontation ensues , in which <entity class="NE" id=12561>Petyr</entity> accuses <entity class="NE" id=12562>Royce</entity> of giving away the information regarding the location of <entity class="NE" id=12563>Sansa Stark</entity> to <entity class="HSE" id=12564>House Bolton</entity> . When <entity class="NE" id=12565>Royce</entity> accuses <entity class="NE" id=12566>Baelish</entity> of slander , <entity class="NE" id=12567>Petyr</entity> reminds him that <entity class="NE" id=12568>Robin</entity> is the <entity class="NE" id=12569>Lord</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12570>Vale</entity> , and asks for his judgment . <entity class="NE" id=12571>Robin</entity> then asks <entity class="NE" id=12572>Baelish</entity> if they should throw <entity class="NE" id=12573>Lord Royce</entity> from the <entity class="NE" id=12574>Moon Door</entity> , which prompts the surrounding knights , including those loyal to <entity class="NE" id=12575>Royce</entity> , to muster themselves . <entity class="NE" id=12576>Royce</entity> swears his loyalty to <entity class="NE" id=12577>Robin</entity> , and he is let off without punishment on <entity class="NE" id=12578>Baelish</entity> 's recommendation . <entity class="NE" id=12579>Royce</entity> comes onto the dark realization that <entity class="NE" id=12580>Littlefinger</entity> has control over <entity class="NE" id=12581>Robin</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12582>Petyr</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12583>Robin</entity> decide they have to muster the <entity class="NE" id=12584>Vale</entity> knights to march <entity class="NE" id=12585>North</entity> and aid <entity class="NE" id=12586>Sansa</entity> . In The <entity class="NE" id=12587>North</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=12588>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12589>Osha</entity> is brought before <entity class="NE" id=12590>Ramsay Bolton</entity> , who says that while her fellow captive <entity class="NE" id=12591>Rickon Stark</entity> has value to <entity class="NE" id=12592>Ramsay</entity> , he is unsure of her worth . <entity class="NE" id=12593>Osha</entity> denounces the <entity class="NE" id=12594>Starks</entity> , saying that her servitude and loyalty to them were forced . She also attempts to seduce <entity class="NE" id=12595>Ramsay</entity> , climbing onto his lap and kissing him , all the while trying to get the knife he had been using to peel apples . <entity class="NE" id=12596>Ramsay</entity> seemingly falls for it , saying that it took much longer for him to get <entity class="NE" id=12597>Theon Greyjoy</entity> over to his side but that <entity class="NE" id=12598>Theon</entity> told him everything , including how <entity class="NE" id=12599>Osha</entity> had seduced Theon in order to help <entity class="NE" id=12600>Rickon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12601>Bran Stark</entity> escape <entity class="NE" id=12602>Winterfell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12603>Osha</entity> realizes that she has been lured into a trap , and tries to stab <entity class="NE" id=12604>Ramsay</entity> , only for him to slash her throat . She dies shortly thereafter . In the <entity class="NE" id=12605>Iron Islands</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12606>Theon</entity> returns home . Theon Greyjoy returns home to <entity class="NE" id=12607>Pyke</entity> , where he learns of the death of his father , <entity class="NE" id=12608>Balon Greyjoy</entity> . His sister , <entity class="NE" id=12609>Yara</entity> , is unhappy about his return and his refusal to leave the <entity class="NE" id=12610>Dreadfort</entity> when she made an attempt to rescue Theon from <entity class="NE" id=12611>Ramsay Bolton</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12612>Theon</entity> explains that <entity class="NE" id=12613>Ramsay</entity> `` broke him into a thousand pieces , '' which <entity class="NE" id=12614>Yara</entity> affirms `` yes , he sent us one of those pieces '' referring to the box containing <entity class="NE" id=12612>Theon</entity> 's penis that she and <entity class="NE" id=12615>Balon Greyjoy</entity> received . <entity class="NE" id=12616>Yara</entity> then suspects that <entity class="NE" id=12617>Theon</entity> has come back to declare himself King of the <entity class="NE" id=12618>Iron Islands</entity> , but he insists that he does not want the crown , instead wishing for <entity class="NE" id=12616>Yara</entity> to rule , with him helping her in any way that he can . In <entity class="NE" id=12619>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12620>Tyrion Lannister</entity> along with <entity class="NE" id=12621>Grey Worm</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12622>Missandei</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=12623>Varys</entity> meet with representatives of the <entity class="NE" id=12624>Good Masters of Astapor</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=12625>Wise Masters</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=12626>Yunkai</entity> , and the slave-trading city of <entity class="NE" id=12627>Volantis</entity> ; who have arrived by sea . As the diplomatic mission enters the harbor , <entity class="NE" id=12628>Grey Worm</entity> advocates using military force . When <entity class="NE" id=12629>Tyrion</entity> explains that he is able to empathize with slaves because he spent one day as a slave , <entity class="NE" id=12630>Missandei</entity> counters that he has not experienced slavery . The emissaries are <entity class="NE" id=12631>Tyrion</entity> 's former slave master <entity class="NE" id=12632>Yezzan zo Qaggaz</entity> , the Yunkai'i Wise <entity class="NE" id=12633>Master Razdal</entity> mo <entity class="NE" id=12634>Eraz</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=12635>Volantene</entity> triarch <entity class="NE" id=12636>Belicho Paenymion</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12637>Varys</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12638>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12639>Missandei</entity> converge to prepare for their meeting . In their meeting chambers , <entity class="NE" id=12640>Yezzan</entity> marvels at how <entity class="NE" id=12641>Tyrion</entity> went from being a nearly-worthless slave to the de facto ruler of <entity class="NE" id=12642>Meereen</entity> . The slave-trading cities offer to give <entity class="NE" id=12643>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> and her mercenaries a large pot of money if they sail away from <entity class="NE" id=12644>Slaver</entity> 's Bay . When <entity class="NE" id=12645>Missandei</entity> defends <entity class="NE" id=12646>Daenerys</entity> 's actions in liberating slaves , <entity class="NE" id=12647>Razdal</entity> contends that slavery has existed for centuries . After hearing their offer , <entity class="NE" id=12648>Tyrion</entity> proposes a counter-offer . He offers to give them a seven-year grace period to phase out slavery and to compensate slave owners , however they must end all backing for the <entity class="NE" id=12649>Sons</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12650>Harpy</entity> ( regardless of whether they admit this backing or not ) . He then cautions them that they will not get a better offer . <entity class="NE" id=12651>Tyrion</entity> then gives them time to consider his offer , though <entity class="NE" id=12652>Grey Worm</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12653>Missandei</entity> insist on abolishing slavery . <entity class="NE" id=12654>Tyrion</entity> and his entourage are later confronted by a crowd of former slaves in the <entity class="NE" id=12655>Meereen</entity> throne room . A freedman demands to know when <entity class="NE" id=12656>Daenerys</entity> will return while another is appalled at the idea of Tyrion negotiating with slave traders . <entity class="NE" id=12657>Tyrion</entity> insists he is doing his best to rule the city in <entity class="NE" id=12658>Daenerys</entity> 's absence . The freedmen do not trust <entity class="NE" id=12659>Tyrion</entity> , a foreigner and a newcomer , and look to <entity class="NE" id=12660>Grey Worm</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12661>Missandei</entity> for reassurance . Despite their misgivings , they both publicly back <entity class="NE" id=12662>Tyrion</entity> 's diplomacy in front of the freedmen . In private , <entity class="NE" id=12663>Grey Worm</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12664>Missandei</entity> warn Tyrion that the masters will outmaneuver him , despite his best efforts to do the same to them . In <entity class="NE" id=12665>Vaes Dothrak</entity> . Ser Ser and <entity class="NE" id=12666>Daario Naharis</entity> approach the outskirts of <entity class="NE" id=12667>Vaes Dothrak</entity> and discard their weapons , as drawing a blade in the city is considered sacrilege . Within the city itself , <entity class="NE" id=12668>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12669>Daario</entity> run afoul of <entity class="NE" id=12670>Akho</entity> and Iggo who see through <entity class="NE" id=12668>Jorah</entity> 's claims to be a wine merchant . <entity class="NE" id=12671>Daario</entity> takes care of <entity class="NE" id=12672>Iggo</entity> while <entity class="NE" id=12673>Akho</entity> tackles <entity class="NE" id=12674>Jorah</entity> . The knight is nearly undone , but <entity class="NE" id=12675>Daario</entity> saves him at the last minute with the stiletto he smuggled in . At <entity class="NE" id=12676>Jorah</entity> 's insistence , <entity class="NE" id=12677>Daario</entity> smashes <entity class="NE" id=12678>Aggo</entity> 's skull with a rock so that no one will think he was killed with a bladed weapon . <entity class="NE" id=12679>Dany</entity> proves to the Dothraki who their true <entity class="NE" id=12680>Khaleesi</entity> is . Meanwhile , the <entity class="NE" id=12681>High Priestess</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12682>Dosh Khaleen</entity> gives Daenerys a commentary on the other crones . Some of them hate <entity class="NE" id=12683>Daenerys</entity> , thinking the <entity class="NE" id=12684>Dothraki</entity> should not interbreed with other races , but the high priestess dismisses them , saying that the <entity class="NE" id=12684>Dothraki</entity> have always interbred and have never been concerned with blood purity . To illustrate her point , the high priestess indicates another of the khaleen , a Lhazareen girl ( <entity class="NE" id=12685>Ornela</entity> ) taken from her village at the age of twelve . <entity class="NE" id=12686>Daenerys</entity> asks to relieve herself , and the high priestess sends <entity class="NE" id=12687>Ornela</entity> with her . As they walk , <entity class="NE" id=12688>Daenerys</entity> learns that <entity class="NE" id=12689>Ornela</entity> 's khal died when she was only sixteen . The pair are interrupted by <entity class="NE" id=12690>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12691>Daario</entity> , who take the <entity class="NE" id=12692>Lhazareen</entity> hostage . <entity class="NE" id=12693>Daenerys</entity> , unsurprised to see them , cancels their plans for escape – they have a slim chance of leaving <entity class="NE" id=12694>Vaes Dothrak</entity> , let alone getting back to <entity class="NE" id=12695>Meereen –</entity> and tells them that she has a plan of her own . She asks Ornela if she is willing to help them , calling her a <entity class="NE" id=12696>Khaleesi</entity> ( queen ) instead of a khaleen ( crone ) . The girl reluctantly agrees . During the <entity class="NE" id=12697>Khalar</entity> vezhven , the khals argue about how to deal with <entity class="NE" id=12698>Iggo</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12699>Akho</entity> 's deaths ; <entity class="NE" id=12700>Khal Moro</entity> defuses the situation by reminding them that <entity class="NE" id=12701>Ahko</entity> was a member of his khalasar , and he does not care about finding the killer if he was stupid enough to get himself killed . <entity class="NE" id=12702>Daenerys</entity> is then brought in by the two priestesses she befriended before . <entity class="NE" id=12703>Moro</entity> insists that she join the dosh khaleen , but another khal expresses interest in making her his khaleesi , while another suggests giving her to the <entity class="NE" id=12704>Wise Masters</entity> in exchange for ten thousand horses . <entity class="NE" id=12705>Daenerys</entity> dismisses all of them ; she claims that they are all petty and weak , and reminds them that <entity class="NE" id=12706>Khal Drogo</entity> was willing to cross the `` poison water '' in `` wooden horses '' for his conquests . <entity class="NE" id=12707>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12708>Daario</entity> bow down to their queen . Stating that none of the khals is fit to lead the <entity class="NE" id=12709>Dothraki</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12710>Daenerys</entity> declares that she will lead them herself . After a pause , <entity class="NE" id=12711>Moro</entity> and the khals burst into laughter . <entity class="NE" id=12712>Dany</entity> reminds them that her husband , in the same temple in which they all now sit , declared that he would lead a <entity class="NE" id=12713>Dothraki</entity> army across the <entity class="NE" id=12714>Narrow Sea</entity> to retake the <entity class="NE" id=12715>Iron Throne</entity> for his khaleesi and that all the khals have done since is to raid and plunder villages in lieu of any meaningful conquest . Disgusted with her insolence , <entity class="NE" id=12716>Moro</entity> declares that she will be raped by each of the khals , then by all of their bloodriders , and then , if she is still alive , by their horses . <entity class="NE" id=12717>Daenerys</entity> is unfazed by the threats , as she knocks down the braziers in the hut , setting everything aflame . The khals desperately attempt to escape the rapidly-spreading fire , only to find the temple 's only door barred , the bodies of the two men guarding it lying dead outside . As the flames climb higher , the dosh khaleen and khalasars gather in confusion . Eventually , the doors collapse and <entity class="NE" id=12718>Daenerys</entity> emerges , naked and unburned , with the entire leadership present at <entity class="NE" id=12719>Vaes Dothrak</entity> dead . Many of the assembled bow immediately , with the high priestess and the rest of the dosh khaleen following after a moment . <entity class="NE" id=12720>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12721>Daario</entity> move to the front of the crowd and bow last .
