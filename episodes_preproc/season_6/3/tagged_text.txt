At the <entity class="NE" id=12117>Wall</entity> . As <entity class="NE" id=12118>Jon Snow</entity> awakens and gasps for air , he slowly sits up and scans the room . He then looks down and is horrified by his stab wounds . <entity class="NE" id=12119>Davos Seaworth</entity> , having returned to the room , is shocked but relieved and quickly helps <entity class="NE" id=12120>Jon</entity> as he struggles to walk . <entity class="NE" id=12121>Davos</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=12122>Jon</entity> if he remembers anything . <entity class="NE" id=12123>Jon</entity> , still shocked , says yes , he remembers getting stabbed by <entity class="NE" id=12124>Olly</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12125>Alliser Thorne</entity> for bringing the Wildlings to <entity class="NE" id=12126>Castle Black</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12127>Melisandre</entity> enters , shocked that the resurrection has worked . She then goes to <entity class="NE" id=12128>Jon</entity> and asks him where he was after his death . <entity class="NE" id=12129>Jon</entity> replies he saw nothing , much to <entity class="NE" id=12130>Melisandre</entity> 's disappointment . Seizing on whatever hope she still has , however , she says that the <entity class="NE" id=12131>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=12132>Light</entity> brought <entity class="NE" id=12133>Jon</entity> back for a reason ; that <entity class="NE" id=12134>Stannis</entity> was not The Prince That Was Promised , but `` someone must be . '' <entity class="NE" id=12135>Davos</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=12136>Melisandre</entity> to leave them alone so <entity class="NE" id=12137>Jon</entity> can adjust to his revival . After he has recovered somewhat , <entity class="NE" id=12138>Jon</entity> dons his <entity class="NE" id=12139>Night's Watch</entity> armor and the <entity class="NE" id=12140>Lord Commander</entity> 's cape , and walks into the courtyard , seeing many of the fellow <entity class="NE" id=12141>Brothers</entity> arrive before him . <entity class="NE" id=12142>Jon</entity> , still struggling to walk properly , comes down and greets the dumbfounded Tormund . <entity class="NE" id=12143>Tormund</entity> jokes with the resurrected <entity class="NE" id=12144>Lord Commander</entity> before hugging him tightly which slightly pains <entity class="NE" id=12145>Jon</entity> due to his stab wounds . <entity class="NE" id=12146>Jon</entity> then greets the relieved <entity class="NE" id=12147>Eddison Tollett</entity> and they embrace . Some time later , <entity class="NE" id=12148>Jon</entity> oversees the public hanging of the traitors responsible for the <entity class="NE" id=12149>Mutiny</entity> at <entity class="NE" id=12150>Castle Black</entity> : <entity class="NE" id=12151>Bowen Marsh</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12152>Othell Yarwyck</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12153>Alliser Thorne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12154>Olly</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12155>Jon</entity> asks if any of the men have last words to say . <entity class="NE" id=12156>Bowen</entity> says <entity class="NE" id=12157>Jon</entity> should n't be alive , stating it 's not right . <entity class="NE" id=12158>Jon</entity> coldly replies , `` Neither was killing me . '' <entity class="NE" id=12159>Yarwyck</entity> pleads <entity class="NE" id=12160>Jon</entity> to tell his family in <entity class="NE" id=12161>White Harbor</entity> that he died fighting the <entity class="NE" id=12162>Wildlings</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12163>Alliser</entity> then says he had a choice : to betray his <entity class="NE" id=12164>Commander</entity> or the <entity class="NE" id=12165>Night's Watch</entity> . He then says that <entity class="NE" id=12166>Jon</entity> bringing the <entity class="NE" id=12167>Wildlings</entity> was a dangerous problem and had to be stopped , and warns him that <entity class="NE" id=12166>Jon</entity> will be fighting their battles forever . <entity class="NE" id=12168>Jon</entity> then moves on to <entity class="NE" id=12169>Olly</entity> , who says nothing and glares furiously at <entity class="NE" id=12168>Jon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12170>Jon</entity> reluctantly cuts down the rope , killing all four traitors . <entity class="NE" id=12171>Jon</entity> looks at <entity class="NE" id=12172>Olly</entity> 's lifeless body . Afterwards , <entity class="NE" id=12173>Jon</entity> takes off his cloak and hands it to the confused Edd . <entity class="NE" id=12174>Jon</entity> then says <entity class="NE" id=12175>Edd</entity> can do whatever he wants with the cloak , unofficially designating <entity class="NE" id=12175>Edd</entity> as the 999th Lord Commander of the <entity class="NE" id=12176>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12177>Jon</entity> then leaves the courtyards and declares his watch has ended , leaving the rest of the <entity class="NE" id=12178>Brothers</entity> look on in shock . On a ship heading for <entity class="NE" id=12179>Oldtown</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12180>Samwell Samwell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12181>Gilly</entity> , and her baby son Sam are sailing on a ship to <entity class="NE" id=12182>Oldtown</entity> . Gilly and <entity class="NE" id=12183>Sam</entity> have never been on a ship before . <entity class="NE" id=12184>Samwell</entity> is seasick and begins throwing up into a chamber pot . Gilly assures <entity class="NE" id=12185>Samwell</entity> that it wo n't be long and says that she ca n't wait to see <entity class="NE" id=12186>Oldtown</entity> . Gilly tells Tarly that the ship 's captain says that <entity class="NE" id=12187>Oldtown</entity> is the most beautiful city in <entity class="NE" id=12188>Westeros</entity> . While <entity class="NE" id=12189>Samwell</entity> had originally planned to go and study at the <entity class="NE" id=12190>Citadel</entity> , he changes his plans since he can not bring Gilly and her child along as the <entity class="NE" id=12190>Citadel</entity> only allows men within its walls . Unwilling to abandon <entity class="NE" id=12191>Gilly</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12192>Sam</entity> to the streets , <entity class="NE" id=12193>Samwell</entity> decides to take them to his ancestral home of <entity class="NE" id=12194>Horn Hill</entity> . While he does not get on with his father <entity class="NE" id=12195>Randyll Tarly</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12196>Samwell</entity> assures <entity class="NE" id=12197>Gilly</entity> that his mother and sister are very kind . <entity class="NE" id=12198>Samwell</entity> wants to do everything to protect <entity class="NE" id=12199>Gilly</entity> and her child from harm . Despite some unease , <entity class="NE" id=12200>Gilly</entity> promises to follow <entity class="NE" id=12201>Samwell</entity> and let him decide what is best for them . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=12202>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12203>Bran</entity> has a vision of the past again . He and the three-eyed raven are at the Tower of <entity class="NE" id=12204>Joy</entity> in <entity class="NE" id=12205>Dorne</entity> , shortly after the end of <entity class="NE" id=12206>Robert</entity> 's Rebellion . The last two of the <entity class="NE" id=12207>Targaryen Kingsguard</entity> stand before the <entity class="NE" id=12208>Tower</entity> and block the way of a small party of <entity class="NE" id=12209>Northmen</entity> led by <entity class="NE" id=12210>Eddard Stark</entity> himself . The three-eyed raven identified one of <entity class="NE" id=12211>Ned</entity> 's companions as <entity class="NE" id=12212>Howland Reed</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12213>Meera</entity> 's father . <entity class="NE" id=12214>Eddard</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=12215>Ser Arthur Dayne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12216>Lord Commander Gerold Hightower</entity> to stand down , and asks why they were n't at the <entity class="NE" id=12217>Trident</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12218>Ser Ser</entity> states that <entity class="NE" id=12219>Rhaegar</entity> ordered them here to guard the tower , so there they remained , even as <entity class="NE" id=12219>Rhaegar</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12220>Aerys</entity> both died . <entity class="NE" id=12221>Eddard</entity> asks where his sister <entity class="NE" id=12222>Lyanna</entity> is , but <entity class="NE" id=12223>Dayne</entity> simply wishes Stark the best in the wars to come . The two Kingsguard draw their swords , with <entity class="NE" id=12224>Ser Arthur</entity> saying , `` And now it begins , '' to which <entity class="NE" id=12225>Eddard</entity> replies `` now it ends . '' The two sides clash , with <entity class="NE" id=12226>Dayne</entity> making short work of a few of <entity class="NE" id=12227>Ned</entity> 's northmen . <entity class="NE" id=12228>Ser Ser</entity> slowly cuts down the number of northmen , but <entity class="NE" id=12229>Ser Gerold</entity> falls to <entity class="NE" id=12230>Ned</entity> 's blade . Eventually , <entity class="NE" id=12231>Ser Arthur</entity> duels <entity class="NE" id=12232>Eddard</entity> one-on-one . <entity class="NE" id=12233>Bran</entity> expresses his shock at <entity class="NE" id=12234>Ser Arthur</entity> 's skills , with the three-eyed raven confirming that the <entity class="NE" id=12235>Sword</entity> of the Morning is better than Ned . <entity class="NE" id=12236>Dayne</entity> easily gains the upper hand and kicks <entity class="NE" id=12237>Ned</entity> 's sword away from him , but is unprepared for <entity class="NE" id=12238>Howland</entity> stabbing him through the back of the neck . Eddard seems visibly uncomfortable at winning this way , but unhesitatingly delivers the killing blow to the incapacitated <entity class="NE" id=12239>Ser Arthur</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12240>Bran</entity> is shocked , as he had heard tales of this duel and never expected his father to stand for such things . <entity class="NE" id=12241>Eddard</entity> runs towards the tower , having heard a woman 's scream come from one of its windows towards the end of the duel . <entity class="NE" id=12242>Bran</entity> runs to follow <entity class="NE" id=12243>Eddard</entity> , calling out , but he is told it 's time to go by the raven . <entity class="NE" id=12244>Ned</entity> looks back for a second , seemingly hearing <entity class="NE" id=12245>Bran</entity> , but then runs into the Tower . <entity class="NE" id=12246>Bran</entity> tries to follow , but he is forced out of the past and back into the cave by the three-eyed raven , saying he had stayed in the past for too long . <entity class="NE" id=12247>Bran</entity> is both angry and sad at this , but the raven asserts it was for his safety , and again sternly reminds him that the past can not be changed . The raven further states that he 's waited a thousand years for <entity class="NE" id=12248>Bran</entity> to arrive , and that <entity class="NE" id=12248>Bran</entity> will not share the raven 's destiny . But before he can leave the cave , <entity class="NE" id=12249>Bran</entity> must learn everything . At <entity class="NE" id=12250>King</entity> 's Landing . The `` Little Bird '' Spies . <entity class="NE" id=12251>Qyburn</entity> is in the company of the little birds , children who used to spy for <entity class="NE" id=12252>Varys</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12253>Qyburn</entity> tries to win the favor of the children by attracting them with candied plums from <entity class="NE" id=12254>Dorne</entity> . Shortly afterwards , <entity class="NE" id=12255>Cersei</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12256>Jaime Lannister</entity> and the reanimated <entity class="NE" id=12257>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> enter . <entity class="NE" id=12258>Cersei</entity> wants <entity class="NE" id=12259>Qyburn</entity> to gather information from <entity class="NE" id=12260>Dorne</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12261>Highgarden</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=12262>North</entity> and wherever people are trying to take advantage of their losses and plotting against them . At the <entity class="NE" id=12263>Small Council</entity> meeting , <entity class="NE" id=12264>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> complains about <entity class="NE" id=12265>Qyburn</entity> and his experiments . <entity class="NE" id=12266>Ser Ser</entity> , now <entity class="NE" id=12267>Hand</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12268>King</entity> - is heading the <entity class="NE" id=12269>Council –</entity> which now consists of himself , <entity class="NE" id=12270>Pycelle</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=12271>Lord Mace Tyrell –</entity> with <entity class="NE" id=12272>Lady Olenna Tyrell</entity> in attendance to lobby for <entity class="NE" id=12273>Margaery</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12274>Loras Tyrell</entity> 's release . <entity class="NE" id=12275>Cersei</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12276>Jaime</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12277>Ser Gregor</entity> enter the room , startling <entity class="NE" id=12278>Pycelle</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12279>Mace</entity> . On being questioned about what they are doing at a small council meeting , <entity class="NE" id=12280>Cersei</entity> replies that she is the Queen , only to be corrected by <entity class="NE" id=12281>Olenna</entity> that the rightful queen is the one married to the king and that <entity class="NE" id=12282>Margaery</entity> is the one who fits that description . Jaime then argues that he , as <entity class="NE" id=12283>Lord Commander</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12284>Kingsguard</entity> , also has a right to attend . <entity class="NE" id=12285>Pycelle</entity> admits that <entity class="NE" id=12286>Ser Gerold Hightower</entity> once sat on the council , but dismisses this due to the <entity class="NE" id=12287>Mad King</entity> 's eccentricities . <entity class="NE" id=12288>Cersei</entity> accuses <entity class="NE" id=12289>Kevan</entity> of not caring for her daughter <entity class="NE" id=12290>Myrcella</entity> , while <entity class="NE" id=12291>Jaime</entity> appeals to the bigger picture and urges <entity class="NE" id=12289>Kevan</entity> to take action against <entity class="NE" id=12292>Ellaria Sand</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=12293>Sand Snakes</entity> who have taken over <entity class="NE" id=12294>Dorne</entity> after eliminating <entity class="HSE" id=12295>House Martell</entity> . Displeased with the newcomers , <entity class="NE" id=12296>Ser Kevan</entity> and the small council leave the hall . Meanwhile , an angry King <entity class="NE" id=12297>Tommen Baratheon</entity> and his <entity class="NE" id=12298>Kingsguard</entity> visits the <entity class="NE" id=12299>High Sparrow</entity> to secure permission for <entity class="NE" id=12300>Cersei</entity> to visit her daughter 's resting place in the <entity class="NE" id=12301>Great Sept</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=12302>High Sparrow</entity> replies that <entity class="NE" id=12303>Cersei</entity> can not visit because she still has not been cleared for the other sins that she is accused of . <entity class="NE" id=12304>Tommen</entity> criticizes the <entity class="NE" id=12305>High Sparrow</entity> for his self-righteous treatment of <entity class="NE" id=12306>Cersei</entity> after she had atoned for two of her crimes . Despite their differences , the <entity class="NE" id=12307>High Sparrow</entity> claims admiration for the deep love that <entity class="NE" id=12308>Cersei</entity> has for her son , <entity class="NE" id=12309>Tommen</entity> , which he attributes to the divine love of the Mother . When <entity class="NE" id=12310>Tommen</entity> asks the <entity class="NE" id=12311>High Sparrow</entity> why he wants to put his mother through more trials , the <entity class="NE" id=12312>Sparrow</entity> replies that he is merely carrying out the will of the Seven . He urges the young King to turn to the Seven for wisdom . Before <entity class="NE" id=12313>Tommen</entity> leaves , less angry and more uncertain , the <entity class="NE" id=12314>High Sparrow</entity> tells him that the Seven have worked through his grandfather and mother even though they may not acknowledge it . In <entity class="NE" id=12315>Meereen</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=12316>Great Pyramid</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12317>Varys</entity> holds court when the <entity class="NE" id=12318>Unsullied</entity> bring in <entity class="NE" id=12319>Vala</entity> , a prostitute who is in league with the <entity class="NE" id=12320>Sons</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12321>Harpy</entity> . She had seduced and murdered several members of the <entity class="NE" id=12322>Second Sons</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12323>Unsullied</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12324>Vala</entity> is defiant and states that she opposes the new regime imposed by the <entity class="NE" id=12325>Unsullied</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12326>Second Sons</entity> as illegitimate . She became a prostitute out of patriotic fervor for the old ways . <entity class="NE" id=12327>Varys</entity> assures Vala he has no interest in torturing her and decides to strike a deal . In return for revealing who is funding the <entity class="NE" id=12328>Sons</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12329>Harpy</entity> , he offers her and her son safe passage on a ship bound for <entity class="NE" id=12330>Pentos</entity> with a bag of silver to start a new life . <entity class="NE" id=12331>Varys</entity> warns her that if she does n't agree to the offer , she will be executed for her crimes , leaving her son orphaned . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=12332>Tyrion</entity> passes the time by engaging <entity class="NE" id=12333>Missandei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12334>Grey Worm</entity> in small talk . <entity class="NE" id=12335>Tyrion</entity> offers to play games with the pair but they are not interested . Before Tyrion can embark on a drinking game , <entity class="NE" id=12336>Varys</entity> returns and informs them that the <entity class="NE" id=12337>Wise Masters</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=12338>Yunkai</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=12339>Good Masters of Astapor</entity> , and the <entity class="NE" id=12340>Free City</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=12341>Volantis</entity> have been secretly funding the <entity class="NE" id=12342>Sons</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12343>Harpy</entity> . While <entity class="NE" id=12344>Grey Worm</entity> advocates attacking the cities , <entity class="NE" id=12345>Missandei</entity> advises against it since that would leave <entity class="NE" id=12346>Meereen</entity> unprotected . Using this information , <entity class="NE" id=12347>Tyrion</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=12348>Varys</entity> to use his little birds to send them a message . In the <entity class="NE" id=12349>Dothraki Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12350>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> walks with the <entity class="NE" id=12351>Dothraki</entity> towards <entity class="NE" id=12352>Vaes Dothrak</entity> and is ushered into the the Temple of the <entity class="NE" id=12353>Dosh Khaleen</entity> by <entity class="NE" id=12354>Khal Moro</entity> 's bloodriders . Upon entering the temple , the <entity class="NE" id=12355>High Priestess</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12356>Dosh Khaleen</entity> orders the bloodriders to leave and strips her naked , giving her a robe which the dosh khaleen wear . As <entity class="NE" id=12357>Daenerys</entity> puts on her new clothes , she tells the high priestess that she will soon regret what she has done as she was the wife of a great khal the Queen of <entity class="NE" id=12358>Meereen</entity> , and the Mother of <entity class="NE" id=12359>Dragons</entity> . The high priestess retorts that she herself was the wife of a previous <entity class="NE" id=12360>Great Khal</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12361>Savo</entity> . Just as <entity class="NE" id=12362>Daenerys</entity> thought she would conquer the world at <entity class="NE" id=12363>Drogo</entity> 's side , so did the high priestess think she would conquer the world at <entity class="NE" id=12364>Savo</entity> 's . But <entity class="NE" id=12365>Savo</entity> was slain , and she joined the dosh khaleen . She is now content , just as <entity class="NE" id=12366>Daenerys</entity> would be if she is allowed to join them . When <entity class="NE" id=12367>Dany</entity> expressed confusion , the priestess points out that khaleesi are supposed to return to <entity class="NE" id=12368>Vaes Dothrak</entity> immediately after their khal 's death . but <entity class="NE" id=12369>Daenerys</entity> went out into the world . She explains that all the khalasars have gathered to decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved , and now they will have to decide what to do with <entity class="NE" id=12370>Daenerys</entity> for not coming to the dosh khaleen after <entity class="NE" id=12371>Khal Drogo</entity> died . In <entity class="NE" id=12372>Braavos</entity> . A blind <entity class="NE" id=12373>Arya Stark</entity> resumes her training with the <entity class="NE" id=12374>Waif</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12375>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> , the former of whom beats her repeatedly when she lies . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=12376>Jaqen</entity> has her mixing potions blindly . During her training , <entity class="NE" id=12377>Arya</entity> continues sparring with the <entity class="NE" id=12378>Waif</entity> while answering questions about her family and the <entity class="NE" id=12379>Hound</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12380>Arya</entity> admits to leaving the <entity class="NE" id=12381>Hound</entity> to die instead of killing him , despite wanting his death . The <entity class="NE" id=12382>Waif</entity> then interrogates <entity class="NE" id=12383>Arya</entity> about the people on her list : <entity class="NE" id=12384>Cersei</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12385>Gregor Clegane</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12386>Walder Frey</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=12387>Waif</entity> voices her disbelief that <entity class="NE" id=12388>Arya</entity> 's list is so short , but <entity class="NE" id=12388>Arya</entity> counters by asking which name she wants added . When <entity class="NE" id=12389>Arya</entity> insists that she is no one , the <entity class="NE" id=12390>Waif</entity> does not believe her and tries to hit her . However , <entity class="NE" id=12391>Arya</entity> is able to deflect her blow and leap out of the way , surprising the <entity class="NE" id=12392>Waif</entity> . After confirming that <entity class="NE" id=12393>Arya</entity> has mastered blind sparring , <entity class="NE" id=12394>Jaqen</entity> approaches <entity class="NE" id=12393>Arya</entity> and offers to give back her sight if she tells him her name . <entity class="NE" id=12395>Arya</entity> replies that `` a girl has no name . '' <entity class="NE" id=12396>Jaqen</entity> then leads <entity class="NE" id=12397>Arya</entity> to the well where he scoops up a bowl of water , which he offers her .
