Accompanied by <entity class="NE" id=12775>Brienne</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12776>Sansa</entity> furiously confronts <entity class="NE" id=12777>Petyr Baelish</entity> , asking if he was aware what <entity class="NE" id=12778>Ramsay Bolton</entity> was capable of . <entity class="NE" id=12779>Baelish</entity> deflects , saying he has the knights of The <entity class="NE" id=12780>Vale</entity> waiting at <entity class="NE" id=12781>Moat Cailin</entity> to aid <entity class="NE" id=12782>Sansa</entity> . She is mistrustful of him when he claims he had no idea of <entity class="NE" id=12783>Ramsay</entity> 's abusive treatment of her .

At <entity class="NE" id=12793>Castle Black</entity> , a war council is called , and is attended by <entity class="NE" id=12794>Sansa</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12795>Brienne</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12796>Podrick</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12797>Jon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12798>Davos</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12799>Melisandre</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12800>Tormund</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12801>Eddison Tollett</entity> , who discuss the need for more men to defend <entity class="NE" id=12793>Castle Black</entity> , since the <entity class="NE" id=12802>Karstarks</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12803>Umbers</entity> , two major Houses in the <entity class="NE" id=12804>North</entity> , have declared for <entity class="NE" id=12805>Ramsay</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12806>Jon</entity> points out that they can summon the rest of the minor <entity class="NE" id=12807>Houses</entity> , such as the <entity class="NE" id=12808>Mormonts</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12809>Glovers</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12810>Cerwyns</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=12811>Mazins</entity> , to rival their enemies , and <entity class="NE" id=12812>Sansa</entity> reveals <entity class="NE" id=12813>Brynden</entity> 's successful retaking of <entity class="NE" id=12814>Riverrun</entity> , though she claims she learned via one of <entity class="NE" id=12815>Ramsay</entity> 's ravens in order to stop <entity class="NE" id=12806>Jon</entity> from pursuing Littlefinger . <entity class="NE" id=12816>Sansa</entity> subsequently tasks <entity class="NE" id=12817>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12818>Podrick</entity> with securing <entity class="NE" id=12819>Brynden</entity> 's help while the rest of them leave <entity class="NE" id=12820>Castle Black</entity> to start building their army . Before leaving <entity class="NE" id=12821>Castle Black</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12822>Sansa</entity> presents <entity class="NE" id=12823>Jon</entity> with a new cloak like their father 's , carrying the <entity class="NE" id=12824>Stark</entity> sigil . In <entity class="NE" id=12825>Braavos</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=12826>Waif</entity> continues to drill <entity class="NE" id=12827>Arya</entity> , mocking her high-born origins . <entity class="NE" id=12828>Jaqen H’ghar</entity> explains that the <entity class="NE" id=12829>Faceless Men</entity> were slaves in <entity class="NE" id=12830>Valyria</entity> before establishing the <entity class="NE" id=12831>Free City</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=12832>Braavos</entity> and the House of <entity class="NE" id=12833>Black</entity> & <entity class="NE" id=12834>White</entity> . Handing Arya a vial , <entity class="NE" id=12835>Jaqen</entity> tells her an actress , <entity class="NE" id=12836>Lady Crane</entity> , will be the next to receive the Many-Faced God’s “gift.” . <entity class="NE" id=12837>Arya</entity> watches The <entity class="NE" id=12838>Bloody Hand</entity> , a stage-play in <entity class="NE" id=12839>Braavos</entity> loosely based on the recent civil wars in <entity class="NE" id=12840>Westeros</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12841>Arya</entity> enjoys the spectacle of the actors re-enacting the War of the <entity class="NE" id=12842>Five Kings</entity> , playing <entity class="NE" id=12843>Baratheons</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12844>Lannisters</entity> , but her pleasure ceases when her father , and his execution , are inaccurately caricatured . <entity class="NE" id=12845>Eddard</entity> is portrayed as a buffoon , and the actress who plays <entity class="NE" id=12846>Sansa</entity> has her breasts bared to the audience . <entity class="NE" id=12847>Arya</entity> sneaks into the dressing room after the play to observe her target – the actress playing <entity class="NE" id=12848>Cersei</entity> – who appears to be a clever , decent woman . <entity class="NE" id=12849>Arya</entity> later shares with <entity class="NE" id=12850>Jaqen</entity> her plan to poison <entity class="NE" id=12851>Lady Crane’s</entity> rum , which no one else in the troupe drinks . <entity class="NE" id=12852>Arya</entity> suspects that a jealous younger actress , <entity class="NE" id=12853>Bianca</entity> , has commissioned the kill . <entity class="NE" id=12854>Jaqen</entity> cuts her off , reminding her a servant does not question . In the <entity class="NE" id=12855>Dothraki Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12856>Jorah</entity> shows his arm to <entity class="NE" id=12857>Daenerys</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12858>Daenerys</entity> is unsure of what to do with <entity class="NE" id=12859>Jorah</entity> , having banished him twice , seeing him defiantly return twice , and him twice saving her life . <entity class="NE" id=12860>Jorah</entity> finally confesses his love for <entity class="NE" id=12861>Daenerys</entity> , but also reveals his spreading greyscale infection , and says that this time , he needs to leave for good . He starts to leave and states his plan to take his own life well before the greyscale envelops him , but <entity class="NE" id=12862>Daenerys</entity> tearfully commands him to find a cure and come back to her side when she conquers <entity class="NE" id=12863>Westeros</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12864>Jorah</entity> then departs while <entity class="NE" id=12865>Daenerys</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12866>Daario Naharis</entity> lead the <entity class="NE" id=12867>Dothraki</entity> horde back to <entity class="NE" id=12868>Meereen</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=12869>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12870>Kinvara</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=12871>High Red Priestess</entity> . While the rulers of <entity class="NE" id=12872>Meereen</entity> enjoy a tenuous peace , <entity class="NE" id=12873>Tyrion</entity> reminds them of the need to convince the Meereenese that everything has been done with <entity class="NE" id=12874>Daenerys</entity> 's blessing , as the <entity class="NE" id=12875>Masters</entity> could use <entity class="NE" id=12873>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12876>Varys</entity> 's foreign status against them to reclaim <entity class="NE" id=12877>Slaver</entity> 's Bay . To that end , <entity class="NE" id=12878>Tyrion</entity> invites <entity class="NE" id=12879>Kinvara</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12880>High Priestess</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12881>Red Temple</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=12882>Volantis</entity> , to negotiate spreading the word of <entity class="NE" id=12883>Daenerys</entity> 's accomplishments . To <entity class="NE" id=12884>Tyrion</entity> 's surprise , <entity class="NE" id=12885>Kinvara</entity> appears to be highly accommodating in supporting <entity class="NE" id=12884>Tyrion</entity> 's goals , as she firmly believes that <entity class="NE" id=12886>Daenerys</entity> is The Prince That Was Promised . <entity class="NE" id=12887>Varys</entity> is more skeptical , being suspicious of any practitioners of magic , and points out that <entity class="NE" id=12888>Melisandre</entity> had already declared <entity class="NE" id=12889>Stannis Baratheon</entity> to be the <entity class="NE" id=12890>Prince</entity> , only for him to be defeated twice . <entity class="NE" id=12891>Kinvara</entity> says that while the <entity class="NE" id=12892>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=12893>Light</entity> has a plan , the humans following him do occasionally make errors . She then unnerves <entity class="NE" id=12894>Varys</entity> by revealing that she knows <entity class="NE" id=12894>Varys</entity> was emasculated by a `` second-rate sorcerer '' and offers to repeat the words he heard in the flames , and identify who it was that spoke . <entity class="NE" id=12895>Varys</entity> is uncharacteristically unsettled by this revelation . <entity class="NE" id=12896>Kinvara</entity> then assures Tyrion that she will send the preachers and priests best suited to the task at hand . In the <entity class="NE" id=12897>Iron Islands</entity> . As the <entity class="NE" id=12898>Kingsmoot</entity> is held , <entity class="NE" id=12899>Yara Greyjoy</entity> is the first to lay claim to the <entity class="NE" id=12900>Salt Throne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12901>Yara</entity> argues that raiding the mainland is not enough for their people , and that they need to use military force to teach the mainlanders a lesson . An Ironborn man challenges <entity class="NE" id=12902>Yara</entity> 's candidacy on the grounds that she is a woman and points out that her brother Theon <entity class="NE" id=12903>Greyjoy</entity> has returned . <entity class="NE" id=12904>Theon</entity> endorses his older sister and urges the gathering to do the same ; stressing that she is a warrior , a reaver , and an Ironborn . Many shout for <entity class="NE" id=12905>Yara</entity> to be their Queen . Before they can crown <entity class="NE" id=12906>Yara</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12907>Euron Greyjoy</entity> joins the gathering to lay claim to the <entity class="NE" id=12908>Salt Throne</entity> . He openly mocks Theon for his military failures and emasculation before deriding <entity class="NE" id=12909>Yara</entity> as a woman . <entity class="NE" id=12910>Yara</entity> in turn accuses <entity class="NE" id=12911>Euron</entity> of killing their King and her father <entity class="NE" id=12912>Balon</entity> . To her surprise , <entity class="NE" id=12913>Euron</entity> admits killing <entity class="NE" id=12914>Balon</entity> but then defends his actions on the grounds that <entity class="NE" id=12914>Balon</entity> was leading them to defeat in the <entity class="NE" id=12915>North</entity> . When <entity class="NE" id=12916>Euron</entity> states that his only regret is not killing <entity class="NE" id=12917>Balon</entity> years earlier , he is met by resounding cheers from the crowd . Theon then counters that <entity class="NE" id=12918>Euron</entity> had spent years gallivanting overseas while <entity class="NE" id=12919>Yara</entity> was commanding <entity class="NE" id=12920>Ironborn</entity> ships and men . <entity class="NE" id=12921>Yara</entity> then suggests building a massive fleet to attack and make their mark on <entity class="NE" id=12922>Westeros</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12923>Euron Euron</entity> , King of the <entity class="NE" id=12924>Iron Islands</entity> . In response , <entity class="NE" id=12925>Euron</entity> announces that he also supports expanding the <entity class="NE" id=12926>Ironborn</entity> fleet . Revealing a trick up his sleeve , he then proposes to marry <entity class="NE" id=12927>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> and then carry her army and dragons back to <entity class="NE" id=12928>Westeros</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=12929>Ironborn</entity> support <entity class="NE" id=12930>Euron</entity> 's plan and declare him king . The Drowned Men priest <entity class="NE" id=12931>Aeron Greyjoy</entity> then leads <entity class="NE" id=12932>Euron</entity> down to the sea to be drowned and reborn , as is the custom . Knowing that <entity class="NE" id=12933>Euron</entity> will kill them as soon as he is able , <entity class="NE" id=12934>Yara</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12935>Theon</entity> , and many of their loyalists flee the <entity class="NE" id=12936>Iron Islands</entity> during <entity class="NE" id=12933>Euron</entity> 's coronation , taking much of the <entity class="NE" id=12937>Iron Fleet</entity> with them . After <entity class="NE" id=12938>Euron</entity> revives himself , he is crowned by his brother <entity class="NE" id=12939>Aeron</entity> . After learning that his niece and nephew have fled with their best ships , <entity class="NE" id=12940>Euron</entity> calls on his followers to build their own ships so that he may pursue the pair and kill them . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=12941>Wall</entity> . The Three-eyed Raven shows <entity class="NE" id=12942>Bran</entity> a vision of a heart tree amid spirals of standing stones in a lush green valley . His vision shows <entity class="NE" id=12943>Leaf</entity> and other Children of the Forest talking amongst themselves , then looking eagerly at a captive bound to the tree . <entity class="NE" id=12944>Leaf</entity> approaches and forces a <entity class="NE" id=12945>Dragonglass</entity> dagger into the captive 's chest . The captive screams , but does not die , instead becoming the first <entity class="NE" id=12946>White Walker</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=12947>Bran</entity> immediately confronts Leaf about creating the <entity class="NE" id=12948>White Walkers</entity> in the first place . <entity class="NE" id=12949>Leaf</entity> tries to explain that they were at war with the <entity class="NE" id=12950>First Men</entity> and were desperate . Later , <entity class="NE" id=12951>Bran</entity> is the only one in the cave awake and is anxious to warg back into the <entity class="NE" id=12952>Weirwood</entity> tree . <entity class="NE" id=12953>Bran</entity> wargs into the tree by himself and sees the <entity class="NE" id=12954>Army</entity> of the Dead . He slowly walks through the army until he comes to a space occupied by four <entity class="NE" id=12955>White Walkers</entity> , including the <entity class="NE" id=12956>Night King</entity> . As <entity class="NE" id=12957>Bran</entity> becomes aware that the The <entity class="NE" id=12958>Night King</entity> and the dead are now able to see him , the <entity class="NE" id=12958>Night King</entity> grabs his arm , branding him with an icy mark . He breaks out of the vision with a scream waking the others . The Three-eyed Raven tells <entity class="NE" id=12959>Bran</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=12960>Meera</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=12961>Hodor</entity> that the <entity class="NE" id=12962>Night King</entity> is now able to locate <entity class="NE" id=12959>Bran</entity> and able to bypass the powerful magic keeping the <entity class="NE" id=12963>White Walkers</entity> and the wights out of the cave . As a result , they must leave now and <entity class="NE" id=12964>Bran</entity> must `` become '' the Three-eyed Raven . <entity class="NE" id=12965>Bran</entity> asks whether he is ready , and the <entity class="NE" id=12966>Raven</entity> says `` No '' at which point <entity class="NE" id=12965>Bran</entity> 's eyes whiten as he enters another vision . As <entity class="NE" id=12967>Meera</entity> and Hodor are preparing to leave they notice the air is so cold their breath is visible , indicating the arrival of the <entity class="NE" id=12968>Army</entity> of the Dead outside of the cave . The <entity class="NE" id=12969>Night King</entity> and three <entity class="NE" id=12970>White</entity> Walkers start marching towards the cave . The <entity class="NE" id=12971>Children</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12972>Forest</entity> try using magic projectiles to fend the <entity class="NE" id=12973>Walkers</entity> off , but are overwhelmed . They light a fire around the entrance which prevents the wights from entering but the <entity class="NE" id=12974>Walkers</entity> extinguish a pathway and walk through . The wights end up climbing over the <entity class="NE" id=12975>Weirwood</entity> and dropping through roots at the top of the cave . <entity class="NE" id=12976>Meera</entity> desperately tries to get <entity class="NE" id=12977>Bran</entity> out of the vision and attempts to get the frightened Hodor to carry <entity class="NE" id=12977>Bran</entity> away to no avail . Using a dragonglass-tipped spear , <entity class="NE" id=12978>Meera</entity> kills the first <entity class="NE" id=12979>White Walker</entity> that enters , and fights alongside the remaining <entity class="NE" id=12980>Children</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12981>Forest</entity> to try to fend off the wights until <entity class="NE" id=12982>Bran</entity> wakes up . Wights begin to swarm the cave , killing all of the <entity class="NE" id=12983>Children</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=12984>Forest</entity> except for <entity class="NE" id=12985>Leaf</entity> , as <entity class="NE" id=12986>Meera</entity> starts yelling at <entity class="NE" id=12987>Bran</entity> to warg into <entity class="NE" id=12988>Hodor</entity> . In the vision , <entity class="NE" id=12989>Bran</entity> is at <entity class="NE" id=12990>Winterfell</entity> watching <entity class="NE" id=12991>Ned Stark</entity> say goodbye to his father , <entity class="NE" id=12992>Rickard Stark</entity> , before being sent to the <entity class="NE" id=12993>Vale</entity> as a ward . While still in the vision , <entity class="NE" id=12994>Bran</entity> hears <entity class="NE" id=12995>Meera</entity> 's cries to warg into <entity class="NE" id=12996>Hodor</entity> and the Three-eyed Raven tells him to listen to her . <entity class="NE" id=12997>Bran</entity> wargs into both the present-day Hodor in the cave <entity class="NE" id=12998>AND Wylis</entity> , the young version of <entity class="NE" id=12999>Hodor</entity> in his vision . <entity class="NE" id=13000>Wylis</entity> seizing , as his words `` hold the door '' evolve into `` Hodor '' . The Hodor in the cave puts <entity class="NE" id=13001>Bran</entity> 's body on a sled and starts hauling him down a tunnel leading out of the cave with <entity class="NE" id=13002>Leaf</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=13003>Meera</entity> , as <entity class="NE" id=13001>Bran</entity> 's direwolf Summer is killed attacking the wights . As the wights are closing in on them , <entity class="NE" id=13004>Leaf</entity> sacrifices herself , using magic to cause a huge explosion , buying the other three enough time to get to a door at the end of the tunnel . While the Three-eyed Raven and <entity class="NE" id=13005>Bran</entity> are still sharing a vision , the <entity class="NE" id=13006>Night King</entity> kills the Three-Eyed Raven , and his figure within <entity class="NE" id=13005>Bran</entity> 's vision blows away as ashes and rags . With some difficulty <entity class="NE" id=13007>Hodor</entity> pushes the door open and pulls <entity class="NE" id=13008>Bran</entity> through , coming back to help <entity class="NE" id=13009>Meera</entity> close the door just as the wights approach . <entity class="NE" id=13010>Meera</entity> grabs <entity class="NE" id=13011>Bran</entity> 's sled and tells <entity class="NE" id=13012>Hodor</entity> to bar the exit , shouting to `` Hold the door ! `` . <entity class="NE" id=13013>Inside Inside</entity> 's vision , <entity class="NE" id=13014>Wylis</entity> notices <entity class="NE" id=13015>Bran</entity> , who links the present Hodor to the past Wylis . <entity class="NE" id=13016>Wylis</entity> begins to seize when he enters the mind of his future self . As <entity class="NE" id=13017>Meera</entity> continues to yell `` Hold the door ! '' to present-day Hodor , within <entity class="NE" id=13018>Bran</entity> 's vision <entity class="NE" id=13019>Wylis</entity> falls to the ground convulsing and starts repeating this same sentence in the midst of his seizure . Eventually , `` hold the door '' slurs into `` Hodor , '' as his condition deteriorates and it becomes apparent this is the moment <entity class="NE" id=13020>Hodor</entity> lost the ability to say any other words , and his destiny was fixed . Present-day Hodor braces himself against the door long enough for <entity class="NE" id=13021>Meera</entity> to disappear into the snow with <entity class="NE" id=13022>Bran</entity> 's unconscious body on the sled . Inevitably , the wights break through parts of the wood and begin scratching and stabbing a visibly distressed Hodor . With no possibility of escape , all that is shown at the end is young Wylis in the past seizing and crying out `` Hodor . `` .
