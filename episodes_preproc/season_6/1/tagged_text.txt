The <entity class="NE" id=11711>Maester</entity> asks if they should bury her or construct a funeral pyre . <entity class="NE" id=11707>Ramsay</entity> says she is good meat and they should feed her to the hounds . <entity class="NE" id=11713>Theon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11703>Sansa</entity> , having survived the fall from <entity class="NE" id=11715>Winterfell</entity> 's wall , run through the <entity class="NE" id=11716>Wolfswood</entity> realizing there are already men with hounds chasing them . Theon tries to hide their scent by crossing a river . Guiding a frightened <entity class="NE" id=11703>Sansa</entity> , they make it across and hide by a fallen tree with Theon hugging <entity class="NE" id=11703>Sansa</entity> to try to keep her warm . Hearing the dogs still after them , <entity class="NE" id=11713>Theon</entity> tries to lead them away , telling <entity class="NE" id=11703>Sansa</entity> to keep heading north for <entity class="NE" id=11720>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11699>Castle Black</entity> . A group of <entity class="NE" id=11722>Bolton</entity> men sent by <entity class="NE" id=11707>Ramsay</entity> , with the <entity class="NE" id=11724>Bastard</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=11725>Girls</entity> , find them . Theon claims <entity class="NE" id=11703>Sansa</entity> was hurt when they jumped and he left her to die , but the dogs find her . The leader mocks Theon over what <entity class="NE" id=11707>Ramsay</entity> will do to him now and prepares to bring them back to <entity class="NE" id=11715>Winterfell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11705>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11730>Podrick</entity> arrive and a fight begins . <entity class="NE" id=11705>Brienne</entity> kills most of them while <entity class="NE" id=11730>Podrick</entity> displays the techniques she taught him , managing to kill one . He is then attacked by another and briefly holds his own before being knocked down but Theon grabs a sword and kills the <entity class="NE" id=11722>Bolton</entity> man . <entity class="NE" id=11703>Sansa</entity> accepts <entity class="NE" id=11705>Brienne</entity> into her service . Where they go next is uncertain . <entity class="NE" id=11736>Roose Roose</entity> meets with <entity class="NE" id=11707>Ramsay</entity> afterwards and asks if preemptively assaulting the struggling army of <entity class="NE" id=11738>Stannis Baratheon</entity> makes him feel like a winner now that they 've lost <entity class="NE" id=11703>Sansa</entity> . A Lannister army marching north could easily overwhelm the <entity class="NE" id=11722>Bolton</entity> troops at <entity class="NE" id=11715>Winterfell</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=11742>Dreadfort</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11707>Ramsay</entity> assures his father they will recapture <entity class="NE" id=11703>Sansa</entity> as he 's sent his best men to find her . <entity class="NE" id=11745>Roose</entity> continues that they need her to rally the north against the <entity class="NE" id=11746>Lannisters</entity> , if need be , and subtly warns Ramsay that if he fails to recapture her , his unborn brother will become his heir . In <entity class="NE" id=11747>Braavos</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=11747>Braavos</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11749>Arya</entity> faces The <entity class="NE" id=11750>Waif</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11749>Arya</entity> is blind and asks for money in the streets , when the <entity class="NE" id=11750>Waif</entity> approaches her with two fighting sticks , and gives her one . <entity class="NE" id=11749>Arya</entity> explains that she ca n't fight because she 's blind , the <entity class="NE" id=11750>Waif</entity> answers `` that 's not my problem '' and starts beating her . <entity class="NE" id=11749>Arya</entity> poorly tries to defend herself but fails miserably , until the <entity class="NE" id=11750>Waif</entity> stops and says that they 'll meet tomorrow . In <entity class="NE" id=11757>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11758>Varys</entity> and Tyrion walking through <entity class="NE" id=11757>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11758>Varys</entity> and Tyrion are seen walking through the city . After coming upon a woman and her baby , <entity class="NE" id=11761>Tyrion</entity> offers a coin , saying the money is for the baby , to eat . His poor <entity class="NE" id=11762>Valyrian</entity> frightens the woman who thinks that he wants to eat her baby . <entity class="NE" id=11758>Varys</entity> intercedes , explaining to the woman the money is so the baby can eat . The relieved woman accepts <entity class="NE" id=11761>Tyrion</entity> 's generosity . As they keep walking through the city , <entity class="NE" id=11761>Tyrion</entity> states that they need to find the leader of the <entity class="NE" id=11766>Sons</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=11767>Harpy</entity> in order to bring peace to <entity class="NE" id=11757>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11758>Varys</entity> said that his spies have been sent all over the city , and that soon they will bring him information . Their conversation is interrupted by a crowd of screaming people running from a huge cloud of smoke . The two make their way towards the origin of the smoke : all the ships in the harbor have been set aflame . In the <entity class="NE" id=11770>Dothraki Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11771>Daenerys</entity> is captured and offered to <entity class="NE" id=11772>Khal Moro</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11773>Daario</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11774>Jorah</entity> are looking for <entity class="NE" id=11771>Daenerys</entity> , and come upon the charred remains of a ram . They note numerous hoof prints on the ground , making <entity class="NE" id=11774>Jorah</entity> realize that the <entity class="NE" id=11777>Dothraki</entity> have been here . On the ground , he finds the ring that <entity class="NE" id=11771>Daenerys</entity> intentionally dropped . <entity class="NE" id=11771>Daenerys</entity> is shown walking with her hands bound , and two Dothraki take her to <entity class="NE" id=11772>Khal Moro</entity> as a gift . The <entity class="NE" id=11781>Khal</entity> wants to rape her , but she explains who she is , <entity class="NE" id=11782>Khal Drogo</entity> 's widow . The <entity class="NE" id=11781>Khal</entity> unbinds her and promises her that she will not be harmed . When <entity class="NE" id=11771>Daenerys</entity> asks to be escorted back to <entity class="NE" id=11757>Meereen</entity> in exchange for the promise of one thousand horses for her safe return , <entity class="NE" id=11786>Moro</entity> 's wife tells her that she has to remain in the temple of <entity class="NE" id=11787>Vaes Dothrak</entity> with the other <entity class="NE" id=11788>Khals</entity> ' widows for the remainder of her days and become a Dosh khaleen . In <entity class="NE" id=11789>Dorne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11790>Doran</entity> dies after <entity class="NE" id=11791>Elliaria</entity> 's deception . <entity class="NE" id=11792>Ellaria</entity> helps <entity class="NE" id=11790>Doran</entity> get to his wheelchair , as they both reminisce about <entity class="NE" id=11794>Oberyn</entity> , with <entity class="NE" id=11790>Doran</entity> stating how he envied his late brother for the adventurous life he led . <entity class="NE" id=11792>Ellaria</entity> states that <entity class="NE" id=11790>Doran</entity> would have made a bad adventurer , while <entity class="NE" id=11794>Oberyn</entity> would have been a bad ruler . After settling into his chair , <entity class="NE" id=11798>Maester Caleotte</entity> brings him a message that <entity class="NE" id=11799>Myrcella</entity> has died . Before he can give an order , <entity class="NE" id=11800>Tyene</entity> stabs <entity class="NE" id=11801>Areo Hotah</entity> in the back , killing him , while <entity class="NE" id=11792>Ellaria</entity> stabs <entity class="NE" id=11790>Doran</entity> in the chest . As he lies on the floor , his guards do nothing , indicating they have sided with <entity class="NE" id=11792>Ellaria</entity> . As she twists her knife into <entity class="NE" id=11790>Doran</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11792>Ellaria</entity> angrily says he remained passive despite the brutal deaths of both his sister and brother , and that the people of <entity class="NE" id=11789>Dorne</entity> are with her , now . As he is gasping , <entity class="NE" id=11790>Doran</entity> begs <entity class="NE" id=11792>Ellaria</entity> to spare <entity class="NE" id=11810>Trystane</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=11792>Ellaria</entity> coldly scoffs at him . <entity class="NE" id=11790>Doran</entity> then dies in a pool of his own blood . In <entity class="NE" id=11812>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=11799>Myrcella</entity> 's corpse arrives from <entity class="NE" id=11789>Dorne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11815>Cersei</entity> is sitting alone in her room , when a servant enters and announces that a ship from <entity class="NE" id=11789>Dorne</entity> has arrived . Realizing that <entity class="NE" id=11799>Myrcella</entity> has come home , she joyfully runs down to the harbor , only to see a grim-faced Jaime alongside a shrouded body . She tearfully realizes that her daughter has died . Later , in the <entity class="NE" id=11818>Red Keep</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11815>Cersei</entity> asks Jaime when was the first time he saw a dead body , to which <entity class="NE" id=11820>Jaime</entity> replies their mother 's . <entity class="NE" id=11815>Cersei</entity> tells of her memory of the horror she felt after first seeing her mother 's corpse , and wishes not to see it happen to <entity class="NE" id=11799>Myrcella</entity> . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=11823>Margaery</entity> is still imprisoned by the <entity class="NE" id=11824>Faith</entity> , and the <entity class="NE" id=11825>High Sparrow</entity> comes to visit her . She asks about her brother , <entity class="NE" id=11826>Loras</entity> , but he tells her that she has to confess first . When she admits that nobody is perfect without sins , he tells her that she is on the right path but still has a long way to go . <entity class="NE" id=11827>Obara</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=11828>Nymeria</entity> arrive on Prince <entity class="NE" id=11810>Trystane</entity> 's ship , announcing their intention to kill him . <entity class="NE" id=11828>Nymeria</entity> offers Trystane the choice of which one of the Sands he 'd like to fight , and he chooses <entity class="NE" id=11828>Nymeria</entity> , only for <entity class="NE" id=11827>Obara</entity> to impale him through the back of his head with her spear as he turns his back on her . At the <entity class="NE" id=11832>Wall</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=11832>Wall</entity> , the mutineers have left <entity class="NE" id=11720>Jon</entity> 's body where he fell . <entity class="NE" id=11835>Ghost</entity> is scratching at the door in grief and howling , which gets the attention of several people , including <entity class="NE" id=11702>Davos</entity> , who leaves his room to investigate . Ser Ser finds <entity class="NE" id=11720>Jon</entity> 's dead body just before <entity class="NE" id=11701>Edd</entity> and some other brothers arrive . They take the body inside where <entity class="NE" id=11701>Edd</entity> clears a table and angrily curses Thorne after closing <entity class="NE" id=11720>Jon</entity> 's eyes . <entity class="NE" id=11702>Davos</entity> asks if <entity class="NE" id=11701>Edd</entity> trusts any of his brothers , and <entity class="NE" id=11701>Edd</entity> replies , `` The ones in this room . '' <entity class="NE" id=11702>Davos</entity> convinces Edd to go bring Ghost in , deciding that they need all the help they can get . <entity class="NE" id=11844>Melisandre</entity> arrives , stating she saw <entity class="NE" id=11720>Jon</entity> fighting in <entity class="NE" id=11715>Winterfell</entity> in the flames . <entity class="NE" id=11702>Davos</entity> and the black brothers doubt the dead <entity class="NE" id=11848>Lord Commander</entity> could do such a thing and she returns to her room . <entity class="NE" id=11849>Alliser Alliser</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11850>Othell Yarwyck</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=11851>Bowen Marsh</entity> hold a meeting with the remaining black brothers stationed at <entity class="NE" id=11699>Castle Black</entity> and explain their reasoning for killing the <entity class="NE" id=11848>Lord Commander</entity> . Most of the brothers come to understand them and side with the mutineers . Back inside the room , <entity class="NE" id=11702>Davos</entity> notes <entity class="NE" id=11700>Thorne</entity> is sure to have made his move by now . In response , <entity class="NE" id=11701>Edd</entity> states he does n't care because <entity class="NE" id=11720>Jon</entity> was his friend and they butchered him , then he rallies the loyal brothers to try and take out Thorne in revenge . <entity class="NE" id=11702>Davos</entity> responds they are hopelessly outnumbered , stating <entity class="NE" id=11835>Ghost</entity> is n't enough when <entity class="NE" id=11701>Edd</entity> brings him up , before reminding them there are others nearby who owe <entity class="NE" id=11720>Jon</entity> their lives . Realizing he means the <entity class="NE" id=11862>Wildlings</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=11701>Edd</entity> instructs them to bar the door and not let anyone in while he sneaks out to get help . All members of the <entity class="NE" id=11864>Watch</entity> are shown bearing arms toward the room where <entity class="NE" id=11720>Jon</entity> 's body is being guarded by <entity class="NE" id=11866>Ser Davos</entity> and the men loyal to <entity class="NE" id=11867>Jon Snow</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=11700>Thorne</entity> and senior members of the <entity class="NE" id=11864>Watch</entity> approach the room and <entity class="NE" id=11700>Thorne</entity> speaks to <entity class="NE" id=11866>Ser Davos</entity> through the locked door . <entity class="NE" id=11700>Thorne</entity> promises full amnesty for the members of the <entity class="NE" id=11864>Watch</entity> . To <entity class="NE" id=11866>Ser Davos</entity> he offers a fresh horse and safe passage to ride south or in any direction he wishes , and that he can take <entity class="NE" id=11844>Melisandre</entity> with him . Ser Ser mocks what he knows to be an insincere offer by requesting mutton . Ser Ser tells Thorne he is a poor hunter and does not want to starve , so he needs some mutton for his trip . <entity class="NE" id=11700>Thorne</entity> promises him food will be provided . Ser Ser says the offer is available as long as everyone in the room surrenders , and does so by sundown . <entity class="NE" id=11844>Melisandre</entity> without her magical glamor of youth . Alone in her bedroom , <entity class="NE" id=11844>Melisandre</entity> appears despondent and looking as if she has been betrayed or led astray by The <entity class="NE" id=11878>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=11879>Light</entity> . On a table next to her bed are various containers , some small that contain potions and other liquids . She unbuttons the front of her dress showing a young beautiful body . She then removes the dress completely and stands nude before a mirror . When she removes her large necklace the gem loses its glow . In the mirror , <entity class="NE" id=11844>Melisandre</entity> 's reflections shows she has transformed or morphed back to a 400-year-old woman she has been said to be , a frail old woman with sagging breasts , leathery skin and thin wispy white hair . Fully nude , with her head bowed down in a despondent manner , she slowly climbs into bed and pulls the fur blanket on top of her .
