At <entity id=11733>Castle Black</entity> , <entity id=11734>Thorne</entity> defends his treason while <entity id=11735>Edd</entity> and <entity id=11736>Davos</entity> defend themselves . <entity id=11737>Sansa</entity> and Theon race the cold and the hounds .

The <entity id=11745>Maester</entity> asks if they should bury her or construct a funeral pyre . <entity id=11746>Ramsay</entity> says she is good meat and they should feed her to the hounds . <entity id=11747>Theon</entity> and <entity id=11748>Sansa</entity> , having survived the fall from <entity id=11749>Winterfell</entity> 's wall , run through the <entity id=11750>Wolfswood</entity> realizing there are already men with hounds chasing them . Theon tries to hide their scent by crossing a river . Guiding a frightened <entity id=11751>Sansa</entity> , they make it across and hide by a fallen tree with Theon hugging <entity id=11751>Sansa</entity> to try to keep her warm . Hearing the dogs still after them , <entity id=11752>Theon</entity> tries to lead them away , telling <entity id=11753>Sansa</entity> to keep heading north for <entity id=11754>Jon</entity> and <entity id=11755>Castle Black</entity> . A group of <entity id=11756>Bolton</entity> men sent by <entity id=11757>Ramsay</entity> , with the <entity id=11758>Bastard</entity> 's <entity id=11759>Girls</entity> , find them . Theon claims <entity id=11760>Sansa</entity> was hurt when they jumped and he left her to die , but the dogs find her . The leader mocks Theon over what <entity id=11761>Ramsay</entity> will do to him now and prepares to bring them back to <entity id=11762>Winterfell</entity> . <entity id=11763>Brienne</entity> and <entity id=11764>Podrick</entity> arrive and a fight begins . <entity id=11765>Brienne</entity> kills most of them while <entity id=11766>Podrick</entity> displays the techniques she taught him , managing to kill one . He is then attacked by another and briefly holds his own before being knocked down but Theon grabs a sword and kills the <entity id=11767>Bolton</entity> man . <entity id=11768>Sansa</entity> accepts <entity id=11769>Brienne</entity> into her service . Where they go next is uncertain . <entity id=11770>Roose Roose</entity> meets with <entity id=11771>Ramsay</entity> afterwards and asks if preemptively assaulting the struggling army of <entity id=11772>Stannis Baratheon</entity> makes him feel like a winner now that they 've lost <entity id=11773>Sansa</entity> . A Lannister army marching north could easily overwhelm the <entity id=11774>Bolton</entity> troops at <entity id=11775>Winterfell</entity> and the <entity id=11776>Dreadfort</entity> . <entity id=11777>Ramsay</entity> assures his father they will recapture <entity id=11778>Sansa</entity> as he 's sent his best men to find her . <entity id=11779>Roose</entity> continues that they need her to rally the north against the <entity id=11780>Lannisters</entity> , if need be , and subtly warns Ramsay that if he fails to recapture her , his unborn brother will become his heir . In <entity id=11781>Braavos</entity> .

In <entity id=11791>Meereen</entity> . <entity id=11792>Varys</entity> and Tyrion walking through <entity id=11793>Meereen</entity> . <entity id=11794>Varys</entity> and Tyrion are seen walking through the city . After coming upon a woman and her baby , <entity id=11795>Tyrion</entity> offers a coin , saying the money is for the baby , to eat . His poor <entity id=11796>Valyrian</entity> frightens the woman who thinks that he wants to eat her baby . <entity id=11797>Varys</entity> intercedes , explaining to the woman the money is so the baby can eat . The relieved woman accepts <entity id=11798>Tyrion</entity> 's generosity . As they keep walking through the city , <entity id=11799>Tyrion</entity> states that they need to find the leader of the <entity id=11800>Sons</entity> of the <entity id=11801>Harpy</entity> in order to bring peace to <entity id=11802>Meereen</entity> . <entity id=11803>Varys</entity> said that his spies have been sent all over the city , and that soon they will bring him information . Their conversation is interrupted by a crowd of screaming people running from a huge cloud of smoke . The two make their way towards the origin of the smoke : all the ships in the harbor have been set aflame . In the <entity id=11804>Dothraki Sea</entity> . <entity id=11805>Daenerys</entity> is captured and offered to <entity id=11806>Khal Moro</entity> . <entity id=11807>Daario</entity> and <entity id=11808>Jorah</entity> are looking for <entity id=11809>Daenerys</entity> , and come upon the charred remains of a ram . They note numerous hoof prints on the ground , making <entity id=11810>Jorah</entity> realize that the <entity id=11811>Dothraki</entity> have been here . On the ground , he finds the ring that <entity id=11812>Daenerys</entity> intentionally dropped . <entity id=11813>Daenerys</entity> is shown walking with her hands bound , and two Dothraki take her to <entity id=11814>Khal Moro</entity> as a gift . The <entity id=11815>Khal</entity> wants to rape her , but she explains who she is , <entity id=11816>Khal Drogo</entity> 's widow . The <entity id=11817>Khal</entity> unbinds her and promises her that she will not be harmed . When <entity id=11818>Daenerys</entity> asks to be escorted back to <entity id=11819>Meereen</entity> in exchange for the promise of one thousand horses for her safe return , <entity id=11820>Moro</entity> 's wife tells her that she has to remain in the temple of <entity id=11821>Vaes Dothrak</entity> with the other <entity id=11822>Khals</entity> ' widows for the remainder of her days and become a Dosh khaleen . In <entity id=11823>Dorne</entity> . <entity id=11824>Doran</entity> dies after <entity id=11825>Elliaria</entity> 's deception . <entity id=11826>Ellaria</entity> helps <entity id=11827>Doran</entity> get to his wheelchair , as they both reminisce about <entity id=11828>Oberyn</entity> , with <entity id=11827>Doran</entity> stating how he envied his late brother for the adventurous life he led . <entity id=11829>Ellaria</entity> states that <entity id=11830>Doran</entity> would have made a bad adventurer , while <entity id=11831>Oberyn</entity> would have been a bad ruler . After settling into his chair , <entity id=11832>Maester Caleotte</entity> brings him a message that <entity id=11833>Myrcella</entity> has died . Before he can give an order , <entity id=11834>Tyene</entity> stabs <entity id=11835>Areo Hotah</entity> in the back , killing him , while <entity id=11836>Ellaria</entity> stabs <entity id=11837>Doran</entity> in the chest . As he lies on the floor , his guards do nothing , indicating they have sided with <entity id=11838>Ellaria</entity> . As she twists her knife into <entity id=11839>Doran</entity> , <entity id=11840>Ellaria</entity> angrily says he remained passive despite the brutal deaths of both his sister and brother , and that the people of <entity id=11841>Dorne</entity> are with her , now . As he is gasping , <entity id=11842>Doran</entity> begs <entity id=11843>Ellaria</entity> to spare <entity id=11844>Trystane</entity> , but <entity id=11843>Ellaria</entity> coldly scoffs at him . <entity id=11845>Doran</entity> then dies in a pool of his own blood . In <entity id=11846>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity id=11847>Myrcella</entity> 's corpse arrives from <entity id=11848>Dorne</entity> . <entity id=11849>Cersei</entity> is sitting alone in her room , when a servant enters and announces that a ship from <entity id=11850>Dorne</entity> has arrived . Realizing that <entity id=11851>Myrcella</entity> has come home , she joyfully runs down to the harbor , only to see a grim-faced Jaime alongside a shrouded body . She tearfully realizes that her daughter has died . Later , in the <entity id=11852>Red Keep</entity> , <entity id=11853>Cersei</entity> asks Jaime when was the first time he saw a dead body , to which <entity id=11854>Jaime</entity> replies their mother 's . <entity id=11855>Cersei</entity> tells of her memory of the horror she felt after first seeing her mother 's corpse , and wishes not to see it happen to <entity id=11856>Myrcella</entity> . Meanwhile , <entity id=11857>Margaery</entity> is still imprisoned by the <entity id=11858>Faith</entity> , and the <entity id=11859>High Sparrow</entity> comes to visit her . She asks about her brother , <entity id=11860>Loras</entity> , but he tells her that she has to confess first . When she admits that nobody is perfect without sins , he tells her that she is on the right path but still has a long way to go . <entity id=11861>Obara</entity> and <entity id=11862>Nymeria</entity> arrive on Prince <entity id=11863>Trystane</entity> 's ship , announcing their intention to kill him . <entity id=11864>Nymeria</entity> offers Trystane the choice of which one of the Sands he 'd like to fight , and he chooses <entity id=11864>Nymeria</entity> , only for <entity id=11865>Obara</entity> to impale him through the back of his head with her spear as he turns his back on her . At the <entity id=11866>Wall</entity> . At the <entity id=11867>Wall</entity> , the mutineers have left <entity id=11868>Jon</entity> 's body where he fell . <entity id=11869>Ghost</entity> is scratching at the door in grief and howling , which gets the attention of several people , including <entity id=11870>Davos</entity> , who leaves his room to investigate . <entity id=11871>Ser Ser</entity> finds <entity id=11872>Jon</entity> 's dead body just before <entity id=11873>Edd</entity> and some other brothers arrive . They take the body inside where <entity id=11874>Edd</entity> clears a table and angrily curses Thorne after closing <entity id=11875>Jon</entity> 's eyes . <entity id=11876>Davos</entity> asks if <entity id=11877>Edd</entity> trusts any of his brothers , and <entity id=11877>Edd</entity> replies , `` The ones in this room . '' <entity id=11878>Davos</entity> convinces Edd to go bring Ghost in , deciding that they need all the help they can get . <entity id=11879>Melisandre</entity> arrives , stating she saw <entity id=11880>Jon</entity> fighting in <entity id=11881>Winterfell</entity> in the flames . <entity id=11882>Davos</entity> and the black brothers doubt the dead <entity id=11883>Lord Commander</entity> could do such a thing and she returns to her room . <entity id=11884>Alliser Alliser</entity> , <entity id=11885>Othell Yarwyck</entity> , and <entity id=11886>Bowen Marsh</entity> hold a meeting with the remaining black brothers stationed at <entity id=11887>Castle Black</entity> and explain their reasoning for killing the <entity id=11888>Lord Commander</entity> . Most of the brothers come to understand them and side with the mutineers . Back inside the room , <entity id=11889>Davos</entity> notes <entity id=11890>Thorne</entity> is sure to have made his move by now . In response , <entity id=11891>Edd</entity> states he does n't care because <entity id=11892>Jon</entity> was his friend and they butchered him , then he rallies the loyal brothers to try and take out Thorne in revenge . <entity id=11893>Davos</entity> responds they are hopelessly outnumbered , stating <entity id=11894>Ghost</entity> is n't enough when <entity id=11895>Edd</entity> brings him up , before reminding them there are others nearby who owe <entity id=11896>Jon</entity> their lives . Realizing he means the <entity id=11897>Wildlings</entity> , <entity id=11898>Edd</entity> instructs them to bar the door and not let anyone in while he sneaks out to get help . All members of the <entity id=11899>Watch</entity> are shown bearing arms toward the room where <entity id=11900>Jon</entity> 's body is being guarded by <entity id=11901>Ser Davos</entity> and the men loyal to <entity id=11902>Jon Snow</entity> . <entity id=11903>Thorne</entity> and senior members of the <entity id=11904>Watch</entity> approach the room and <entity id=11903>Thorne</entity> speaks to <entity id=11905>Ser Davos</entity> through the locked door . <entity id=11906>Thorne</entity> promises full amnesty for the members of the <entity id=11907>Watch</entity> . To <entity id=11908>Ser Davos</entity> he offers a fresh horse and safe passage to ride south or in any direction he wishes , and that he can take <entity id=11909>Melisandre</entity> with him . <entity id=11910>Ser Ser</entity> mocks what he knows to be an insincere offer by requesting mutton . <entity id=11911>Ser Ser</entity> tells Thorne he is a poor hunter and does not want to starve , so he needs some mutton for his trip . <entity id=11912>Thorne</entity> promises him food will be provided . <entity id=11913>Ser Ser</entity> says the offer is available as long as everyone in the room surrenders , and does so by sundown . <entity id=11914>Melisandre</entity> without her magical glamor of youth . Alone in her bedroom , <entity id=11915>Melisandre</entity> appears despondent and looking as if she has been betrayed or led astray by The <entity id=11916>Lord</entity> of <entity id=11917>Light</entity> . On a table next to her bed are various containers , some small that contain potions and other liquids . She unbuttons the front of her dress showing a young beautiful body . She then removes the dress completely and stands nude before a mirror . When she removes her large necklace the gem loses its glow . In the mirror , <entity id=11918>Melisandre</entity> 's reflections shows she has transformed or morphed back to a 400-year-old woman she has been said to be , a frail old woman with sagging breasts , leathery skin and thin wispy white hair . Fully nude , with her head bowed down in a despondent manner , she slowly climbs into bed and pulls the fur blanket on top of her .
