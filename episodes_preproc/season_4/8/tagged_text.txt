<entity class="NE" id=8404>Unexpected</entity> visitors arrive in <entity class="NE" id=8405>Mole</entity> 's Town . <entity class="NE" id=8406>Littlefinger</entity> 's motives are questioned . <entity class="NE" id=8407>Ramsay</entity> tries to prove himself to his father . <entity class="NE" id=8408>Tyrion</entity> 's fate is decided . In the <entity class="NE" id=8409>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8410>Ramsay Ramsay</entity> sends <entity class="NE" id=8411>Reek</entity> , forced to reassume his former identity of Theon Greyjoy , to treat with the ironborn garrison holding the northern fortress of <entity class="NE" id=8412>Moat Cailin</entity> , barring the armies of <entity class="HSE" id=8413>House Bolton</entity> from returning to the <entity class="NE" id=8409>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8415>Theon</entity> rides into the fortress to find corpses lying everywhere from constant attacks , and disease is running rampant ; the ironborn remaining are sick , under-equipped and outnumbered . The garrison commander , <entity class="NE" id=8416>Ralf Kenning</entity> , rebuffs the offer made by <entity class="NE" id=8407>Ramsay</entity> of safe passage in exchange for surrender , and clearly thinks Theon to be an imposter , but he is cut down by one of his men , who accepts it on behalf of the soldiers . The ironborn surrender to <entity class="NE" id=8407>Ramsay</entity> , but he has them killed and flayed regardless . In the aftermath , <entity class="NE" id=8407>Ramsay</entity> meets with his father and presents him with the <entity class="NE" id=8420>Greyjoy</entity> banner that was flying over the fortress . In recognition , <entity class="NE" id=8421>Roose</entity> presents <entity class="NE" id=8407>Ramsay</entity> with a decree of legitimization , making him officially a member of <entity class="HSE" id=8413>House Bolton</entity> . Delighted at the knowledge he will succeed his father as <entity class="NE" id=8424>Warden</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=8409>North</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8407>Ramsay</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8411>Reek</entity> accompany <entity class="NE" id=8421>Roose</entity> 's army as it approaches its final destination : the ruins of <entity class="NE" id=8429>Winterfell</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=8405>Mole</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=8431>Town</entity> , a whore is arguing with <entity class="NE" id=8432>Gilly</entity> about her baby who woke her up during the night . Meanwhile , wildlings , including <entity class="NE" id=8433>Tormund</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8434>Styr</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8435>Ygritte</entity> , attack the town , killing everyone in their path . <entity class="NE" id=8435>Ygritte</entity> discovers Gilly hiding with her baby , but urges them to keep quiet , sparing their lives . At the <entity class="NE" id=8437>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8438>News</entity> from M​ole 's <entity class="NE" id=8431>Town</entity> has arrived at <entity class="NE" id=8440>Castle Black</entity> , where <entity class="NE" id=8441>Sam</entity> worries about <entity class="NE" id=8432>Gilly</entity> , blaming himself for bringing her to the town instead of keeping her with him at <entity class="NE" id=8440>Castle Black</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8443>Grenn</entity> is angry at them cowering in the castle instead of helping their brothers in neighboring towns . <entity class="NE" id=8444>Jon Jon</entity> says they ca n't go out to fight against the wildlings , as that is exactly what they want . <entity class="NE" id=8445>Pypar</entity> and Edd try to comfort <entity class="NE" id=8441>Sam</entity> by saying she might be alive and hiding , as she has survived worse situations , such as living with <entity class="NE" id=8447>Craster</entity> , making a long march to the <entity class="NE" id=8437>Wall</entity> , and even surviving a <entity class="NE" id=8449>White Walker</entity> . This gives <entity class="NE" id=8441>Sam</entity> hope that <entity class="NE" id=8432>Gilly</entity> and her baby may have survived . <entity class="NE" id=8452>Jon</entity> notes they have a bigger problem ; if <entity class="NE" id=8405>Mole</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=8431>Town</entity> has been destroyed , <entity class="NE" id=8440>Castle Black</entity> is next , and the few black brothers who remain are outnumbered a thousand to one by <entity class="NE" id=8456>Mance Rayder</entity> 's army . <entity class="NE" id=8457>Edd</entity> notes that if the wildlings do n't kill them all , there is even worse behind them that will finish the job , and asks whichever last man of the group is still alive at the end to burn the others , as he does n't want to come back after he is dead . Across the <entity class="NE" id=8458>Narrow Sea</entity> . As <entity class="NE" id=8459>Grey Worm</entity> is swimming with some other Unsullied outside <entity class="NE" id=8460>Meereen</entity> , he notices <entity class="NE" id=8461>Missandei</entity> and a number of other women bathing naked downstream . She spots him looking at her and returns his gaze , standing up slowly for him to see her before finally covering herself . Later <entity class="NE" id=8462>Daenerys</entity> asks whether <entity class="NE" id=8461>Missandei</entity> thinks he was spying on her . She says no , and <entity class="NE" id=8462>Daenerys</entity> mentions that <entity class="NE" id=8465>Dothraki</entity> have no taboos against nudity or public love-making . Of course , <entity class="NE" id=8461>Missandei</entity> is not <entity class="NE" id=8465>Dothraki</entity> , but she says it does n't matter , as <entity class="NE" id=8459>Grey Worm</entity> is n't interested in her – none of the <entity class="NE" id=8469>Unsullied</entity> desire women . <entity class="NE" id=8461>Missandei</entity> says he was interested though , surprisingly to both of them . <entity class="NE" id=8462>Daenerys</entity> inquires whether , when a slave is castrated , the masters take `` all of it '' ; both the `` pillar '' and the `` stones . '' <entity class="NE" id=8461>Missandei</entity> says she does n't know , to which <entity class="NE" id=8462>Daenerys</entity> asks if she 's ever wondered . <entity class="NE" id=8474>Thoughtful</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8461>Missandei</entity> confirms that she has . In <entity class="NE" id=8476>Dany</entity> 's audience chamber , <entity class="NE" id=8459>Grey Worm</entity> comes to apologize to <entity class="NE" id=8461>Missandei</entity> , but she tells him he does n't need to . He hopes he did n't frighten her , and she says he did not . Addressing her in the <entity class="NE" id=8479>Common Tongue</entity> , he tells her the lessons she gives are precious to him . Gently correcting his vocabulary , she notes that she does n't remember teaching him the word `` precious . '' <entity class="NE" id=8480>Grey Grey</entity> tells her that <entity class="NE" id=8481>Jorah</entity> taught it to him . She asks whether he remembers his birth name , and <entity class="NE" id=8459>Grey Worm</entity> says he remembers nothing . She asks if he remembers when they cut him , and he shakes his head `` no . '' She tells him she 's sorry they did that to him , and when <entity class="NE" id=8459>Grey Worm</entity> asks her why , she says it 's a terrible thing to do to a boy . <entity class="NE" id=8480>Grey Grey</entity> counters that , had the masters not cut him , he never would have been <entity class="NE" id=8469>Unsullied</entity> , he never would have been freed , chosen to lead them , and met her . <entity class="NE" id=8461>Missandei</entity> is visibly moved by this . <entity class="NE" id=8480>Grey Grey</entity> apologizes once again , and she stops him while he turns to leave , telling him she is glad he saw her . He tells her he 's glad as well . As <entity class="NE" id=8488>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> watches the Unsullied taking the bodies of the crucified masters down outside <entity class="NE" id=8460>Meereen</entity> , a small boy approaches him , giving him a scroll bearing the seal of the <entity class="NE" id=8490>Hand</entity> . He reads its contents slowly in consternation . He confronts <entity class="NE" id=8491>Ser Jorah</entity> : the document is a royal pardon signed by King <entity class="NE" id=8492>Robert Baratheon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8493>Barristan</entity> surmises <entity class="NE" id=8481>Jorah</entity> spied on Daenerys in exchange for the pardon . <entity class="NE" id=8481>Jorah</entity> begs to be allowed to speak with her privately , but <entity class="NE" id=8493>Barristan</entity> tells him that he will never be alone with her again . In an audience before her , a seething <entity class="NE" id=8462>Daenerys</entity> demands an explanation , and <entity class="NE" id=8481>Jorah</entity> says it is a ploy by <entity class="NE" id=8499>Tywin Lannister</entity> to divide them . <entity class="NE" id=8476>Dany</entity> counters that the pardon was signed the year they met . Asking him whether he claims the pardon was forged , <entity class="NE" id=8481>Jorah</entity> admits that it was not . He soon confesses to giving <entity class="NE" id=8502>Varys</entity> information on <entity class="NE" id=8462>Daenerys</entity> ' activities in <entity class="NE" id=8504>Essos</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8462>Daenerys</entity> angrily says that his telling them of her pregnancy by <entity class="NE" id=8506>Khal Drogo</entity> led to her near-poisoning at the hands of a wine merchant . <entity class="NE" id=8481>Jorah</entity> then protests that his actions stopped her from being poisoned , but <entity class="NE" id=8462>Daenerys</entity> retorts this was only because he knew it might be coming . <entity class="NE" id=8481>Jorah</entity> begs for her forgiveness , but <entity class="NE" id=8462>Daenerys</entity> rebuffs him , saying he betrayed her , selling her secrets to the man she holds responsible for the death of her family . She spares his life , however , and gives him a day to leave <entity class="NE" id=8460>Meereen</entity> . She warns that if he is seen in the city after that , his head will be thrown into <entity class="NE" id=8512>Slaver</entity> 's Bay . <entity class="NE" id=8481>Jorah</entity> is last seen riding from <entity class="NE" id=8460>Meereen</entity> on a horse . In the <entity class="NE" id=8515>Vale</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8516>Petyr Petyr</entity> is testifying before a tribunal consisting of <entity class="NE" id=8517>Lord Yohn Royce</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8518>Lady Anya Waynwood</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=8519>Ser Vance Corbray</entity> . The lords are suspicious of <entity class="NE" id=8520>Lysa Arryn</entity> 's death , which occured so soon after her marriage . <entity class="NE" id=8521>Baelish</entity> has been attempting to spin the death as a suicide , but the lords do n't believe him , given <entity class="NE" id=8522>Lysa</entity> 's devotion to her son . They rebuff <entity class="NE" id=8406>Littlefinger</entity> 's explanations in favor of speaking with the only other witness : his `` niece , '' <entity class="NE" id=8524>Alayne</entity> . After confirming that <entity class="NE" id=8521>Baelish</entity> can stay for her testimony , <entity class="NE" id=8526>Sansa</entity> reveals her true identity and relates the tale of her captivity and escape from <entity class="NE" id=8527>King</entity> 's Landing . She continues , truthfully telling of <entity class="NE" id=8522>Lysa</entity> 's mental instability , jealousy and death , changing only a few details ( saying <entity class="NE" id=8406>Littlefinger</entity> only kissed her on the cheek and <entity class="NE" id=8522>Lysa</entity> threw herself through the <entity class="NE" id=8530>Moon Door</entity> ) . <entity class="NE" id=8526>Sansa</entity> breaks down in tears and the lords are convinced , but while none of them are looking , she gives Littlefinger a stone-faced look . Later , <entity class="NE" id=8521>Baelish</entity> visits <entity class="NE" id=8526>Sansa</entity> and asks why she lied on his behalf . <entity class="NE" id=8526>Sansa</entity> explains that she has no idea what <entity class="NE" id=8535>Royce</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8536>Corbray</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=8537>Waynwood</entity> would want from her if he were eliminated , but that she does know what it is he wants . <entity class="NE" id=8406>Littlefinger</entity> seems impressed that she made such a calculating decision , but attempts to cast doubt on her certainty , by asking if she really knows what he wants . Later on , as <entity class="NE" id=8406>Littlefinger</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8540>Robin</entity> prepare to depart on a tour of the <entity class="NE" id=8515>Vale</entity> , a raven-haired <entity class="NE" id=8526>Sansa</entity> accompanies them , in a feathered black dress with a plunging neckline . At some point , before or after this event , <entity class="NE" id=8543>Sandor Clegane</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8544>Arya Stark</entity> arrive at the <entity class="NE" id=8545>Bloody Gate</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=8546>Eyrie</entity> and are informed of <entity class="NE" id=8522>Lysa</entity> 's death by <entity class="NE" id=8548>Ser Donnel Waynwood</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=8549>Hound</entity> stares in shock , while <entity class="NE" id=8550>Arya</entity> begins laughing due to the irony . At <entity class="NE" id=8527>King</entity> 's Landing . In the last hours before his trial by combat , <entity class="NE" id=8408>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8553>Jaime</entity> share a final drink in <entity class="NE" id=8408>Tyrion</entity> 's cell and reminisce about <entity class="NE" id=8554>Orson Lannister</entity> , their simple-minded cousin who spent his days smashing beetles with a rock . <entity class="NE" id=8408>Tyrion</entity> tells Jaime of how he used to observe <entity class="NE" id=8556>Orson</entity> day after day in an attempt to understand his motives , but in the end he was never able to come to reach any understanding . <entity class="NE" id=8408>Tyrion</entity> asks Jaime if he thinks <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> stands a chance , but <entity class="NE" id=8553>Jaime</entity> is not optimistic . As a bell rings out to announce daybreak in the city , <entity class="NE" id=8553>Jaime</entity> takes his leave , wishing his brother luck . Lannister guardsmen escort <entity class="NE" id=8408>Tyrion</entity> to the arena , where a large crowd has assembled . He grows apprehensive to find a helm-less Oberyn drinking , and wearing very light armor – in comparison to his opponent , <entity class="NE" id=8562>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> , clad from head to foot in heavy armor and wielding a greatsword . <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> dismisses <entity class="NE" id=8408>Tyrion</entity> 's concerns , noting that he always drinks before a fight and favors speed over protection . As <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> and his squire make their way to the arena , <entity class="NE" id=8566>Ellaria</entity> becomes concerned , noting that The <entity class="NE" id=8567>Mountain</entity> is the biggest man she 's ever seen , but <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> remains confident that he will emerge triumphant . <entity class="NE" id=8569>Grand Grand</entity> steps into the arena and begins making a long-winded speech asking the gods to favor the innocent before <entity class="NE" id=8499>Tywin Lannister</entity> cuts him short and begins the trial by combat . <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> , after impressing the crowd with a display of acrobatic spear maneuvers , goes on the attack , stabbing out at <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> and constantly moving out of the knight 's reach , forcing <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> to tire himself out chasing his opponent . As he evades <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> repeatedly taunts <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> by constantly bringing up his part in the murder of his sister , <entity class="NE" id=8575>Elia Martell</entity> , and her children , and demanding a confession , only enraging <entity class="NE" id=8576>Clegane</entity> further . As the fight progresses , <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> manages to seriously injure <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> , stabbing him first in the chest , severing his hamstring and then burying his spear in <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> 's stomach , pinning him to the floor . As <entity class="NE" id=8553>Jaime</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8408>Tyrion</entity> exchange a relieved grin across the arena , a furious <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> circles the prone <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> , demanding that before he dies , <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> confess to murdering <entity class="NE" id=8583>Elia</entity> and her children , raping <entity class="NE" id=8583>Elia</entity> , and that it was <entity class="NE" id=8584>Tywin</entity> who gave the order . However , <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> stands too close to his seemingly defeated opponent , and <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> manages to trip and seize him . <entity class="NE" id=8587>Berserk</entity> with fury , <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> grabs Oberyn by the throat and lifts him off the ground , smashing out most of his teeth with a single devastating punch . Climbing on top of <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8565>Gregor</entity> finally admits for all to hear that he raped and killed <entity class="NE" id=8583>Elia</entity> as he gouges out <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> 's eyes with his thumbs before crushing the <entity class="NE" id=8592>Viper</entity> 's skull between his hands , which he proclaims having done the same to his sister . As <entity class="NE" id=8566>Ellaria</entity> screams in horror , a stunned silence sweeps over the crowd . The short joyful moments for <entity class="NE" id=8408>Tyrion</entity> and Jaime are shattered , as <entity class="NE" id=8584>Tywin</entity> stands and proclaims the will of the gods is clear : Tyrion is guilty and sentenced to death . <entity class="NE" id=8408>Tyrion</entity> can not even reply , shockingly staring in catatonic astonishment at <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> 's skull-crushed corpse , as does <entity class="NE" id=8553>Jaime</entity> ; the only different reaction is from <entity class="NE" id=8599>Cersei</entity> , who stares at <entity class="NE" id=8558>Oberyn</entity> 's slaughtered body , listening to <entity class="NE" id=8408>Tyrion</entity> 's death sentence while smirking in vindication .
