<entity class="NE" id=7711>Dany</entity> balances justice and mercy . <entity class="NE" id=7712>Jaime</entity> tasks <entity class="NE" id=7713>Brienne</entity> with his honor . <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> secures volunteers while <entity class="NE" id=7715>Bran</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7716>Jojen</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7717>Meera</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7718>Hodor</entity> stumble on shelter . Across the <entity class="NE" id=7719>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7720>Daenerys</entity> has 163 of the <entity class="NE" id=7721>Great Masters</entity> crucified . <entity class="NE" id=7722>Missandei</entity> teaches <entity class="NE" id=7723>Grey Worm</entity> how to speak the <entity class="NE" id=7724>Common Tongue</entity> , where he reveals that all he remembers since his castration is that he was born in the <entity class="NE" id=7725>Summer Isles</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7722>Missandei</entity> also reveals that she can remember that she saw <entity class="NE" id=7727>Naath</entity> burning , as she was tacken as a slave for <entity class="NE" id=7728>Slaver</entity> 's Bay . <entity class="NE" id=7711>Dany</entity> commands him and several Unsullied to infiltrate <entity class="NE" id=7730>Meereen</entity> disguised as slaves and convince the slaves to rise against their masters . They visit a slave pen , where a number of slaves are discussing whether or not to rise against the <entity class="NE" id=7721>Great Masters</entity> . One of the young slaves is already trying to convince his fellow men in chains to fight , but the older slaves argue they have no means to oppose their Masters , who have squashed every previous slave rebellion . <entity class="NE" id=7732>Grey Grey</entity> arrives and tells them that only they can free themselves , then presents them with weapons . The uprising is a resounding success . With the city hers , <entity class="NE" id=7711>Dany</entity> orders the crucifixion of 163 of the so-called `` <entity class="NE" id=7721>Great Masters</entity> '' in retaliation for the 163 slave children crucified on the road to <entity class="NE" id=7730>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7736>Ser Barristan</entity> advises her against it , saying that sometimes it is best to answer injustice with mercy . <entity class="NE" id=7720>Daenerys</entity> shows her Targaryen blood by firmly declaring that she will `` answer injustice with justice . '' The cries of the crucified <entity class="NE" id=7721>Great Masters</entity> reach <entity class="NE" id=7711>Dany</entity> 's ears atop <entity class="NE" id=7730>Meereen</entity> 's tallest pyramid , where the city 's emblem , the golden harpy of <entity class="NE" id=7741>Ghis</entity> , has been draped in the banner of <entity class="HSE" id=7742>House Targaryen</entity> . Now , she has conquered all three of the cities on <entity class="NE" id=7728>Slaver</entity> 's Bay . At the <entity class="NE" id=7744>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7745>Jon Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7746>Grenn</entity> are teaching several recruits , including <entity class="NE" id=7747>Locke</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7748>Olly</entity> , how to fight against wildlings . <entity class="NE" id=7749>Alliser Alliser</entity> admonishes <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> and reminds him that he is a steward , not a ranger , trying to provoke <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> in an excuse to have him killed . <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> leaves the yard and talks with <entity class="NE" id=7747>Locke</entity> , who pretends he is from the <entity class="NE" id=7753>Stormlands</entity> and genuinely wants to protect the realm . <entity class="NE" id=7754>Janos Janos</entity> points out to Thorne that <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> is well liked and <entity class="NE" id=7756>Thorne</entity> is not , and when <entity class="NE" id=7757>Maester Aemon</entity> insists upon an election for a new Lord Commander , <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> is far more likely to succeed <entity class="NE" id=7758>Mormont</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7759>Slynt</entity> convinces <entity class="NE" id=7756>Thorne</entity> to allow <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> to deal with the mutineers , in the hope that they will remove him from the problem . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=7762>Samwell Tarly</entity> is fretting about <entity class="NE" id=7763>Gilly</entity> 's safety in <entity class="NE" id=7764>Mole</entity> 's Town with the wildlings loose , and it is revealed that <entity class="NE" id=7765>Sam</entity> told <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> about <entity class="NE" id=7715>Bran</entity> still being alive and north of the wall . <entity class="NE" id=7747>Locke</entity> brings <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=7756>Thorne</entity> , who sanctions his mission but tells <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> that he must secure volunteers rather than have men ordered along with him . <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> gives an impassioned speech , insisting that not only must the mutineers be dealt with for <entity class="NE" id=7772>Castle Black</entity> 's safety , but <entity class="NE" id=7773>Lord Commander Mormont</entity> deserves justice . Much to <entity class="NE" id=7756>Thorne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7759>Slynt</entity> 's surprise , <entity class="NE" id=7746>Grenn</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7777>Eddison Tollett</entity> and a group of other men join <entity class="NE" id=7714>Jon</entity> on his mission , including <entity class="NE" id=7747>Locke</entity> who asks to say his vows if that is required before he goes north of the <entity class="NE" id=7744>Wall</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=7781>King</entity> 's Landing . During their sword training , <entity class="NE" id=7782>Bronn</entity> implores <entity class="NE" id=7712>Jaime</entity> to visit his brother Tyrion in the dungeon , saying that <entity class="NE" id=7784>Tyrion</entity> named Jaime his champion in The <entity class="NE" id=7785>Eyrie</entity> because he knew <entity class="NE" id=7712>Jaime</entity> would ride day and night to fight for him . Jaime finally visits <entity class="NE" id=7784>Tyrion</entity> , confessing that <entity class="NE" id=7787>Cersei</entity> asked him to murder him . Convincing Jaime that he did n't kill <entity class="NE" id=7788>Joffrey</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7784>Tyrion</entity> notes that not even an irrefutable confession by the real perpetrator would satisfy <entity class="NE" id=7787>Cersei</entity> . She is out for <entity class="NE" id=7784>Tyrion</entity> 's blood , and he says that the trial is even worse because at least one judge has always wanted him dead . <entity class="NE" id=7712>Jaime</entity> tells Tyrion that <entity class="NE" id=7787>Cersei</entity> offers a knighthood to whomever captures <entity class="NE" id=7794>Sansa Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7784>Tyrion</entity> insists that <entity class="NE" id=7796>Sansa</entity> had nothing to do with the murder , despite having the best motive . Later , <entity class="NE" id=7712>Jaime</entity> visits <entity class="NE" id=7787>Cersei</entity> , who is disgusted that , in her view , <entity class="NE" id=7712>Jaime</entity> is taking <entity class="NE" id=7784>Tyrion</entity> 's side because of his long-held affection for their brother . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=7800>Lady Olenna</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=7801>Margaery</entity> that she is about to leave for <entity class="NE" id=7802>Highgarden</entity> . She mentions the new and prospective marriage between <entity class="NE" id=7801>Margaery</entity> and the new king , <entity class="NE" id=7804>Tommen</entity> . She insists that <entity class="NE" id=7787>Cersei</entity> will turn <entity class="NE" id=7804>Tommen</entity> against <entity class="NE" id=7801>Margaery</entity> by the time they marry if <entity class="NE" id=7801>Margaery</entity> does n't act fast . Fortunately , <entity class="NE" id=7787>Cersei</entity> is well distracted by accusing her innocent brother of the murder of her son . <entity class="NE" id=7801>Margaery</entity> insists that <entity class="NE" id=7810>Olenna</entity> can not be certain of <entity class="NE" id=7784>Tyrion</entity> 's innocence , but <entity class="NE" id=7810>Olenna</entity> states that <entity class="NE" id=7784>Tyrion</entity> certainly is innocent and confesses that she would never have let <entity class="NE" id=7801>Margaery</entity> marry `` that beast . '' <entity class="NE" id=7801>Margaery</entity> is shocked but her grandmother firmly ends the conversation . That night , <entity class="NE" id=7801>Margaery</entity> enters <entity class="NE" id=7804>Tommen</entity> 's chambers , slipping past the <entity class="NE" id=7815>Kingsguard</entity> and charming <entity class="NE" id=7804>Tommen</entity> . She puts in his mind the idea that one day she will be his and they might as well learn to like each other , and compliments him on his cat and kind demeanour . She promises to visit again and <entity class="NE" id=7804>Tommen</entity> falls asleep smiling . In the chambers of the <entity class="NE" id=7815>Kingsguard</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7712>Jaime</entity> tasks <entity class="NE" id=7713>Brienne</entity> with finding <entity class="NE" id=7796>Sansa</entity> . He urges her to find and keep the girl safe from those who would hand her over to <entity class="NE" id=7787>Cersei</entity> and provides her with a horse , supplies , and a freshly forged suit of armor . Jaime then gifts her with the sword his father gave him , saying that the <entity class="NE" id=7822>Valyrian</entity> steel is forged from <entity class="NE" id=7823>Ned Stark</entity> 's sword and that the steel from <entity class="NE" id=7823>Ned Stark</entity> 's sword should be used to defend <entity class="NE" id=7823>Ned Stark</entity> 's daughters . He also insists she take <entity class="NE" id=7824>Podrick Payne</entity> with her as a squire , both as a reward for the boy 's service to <entity class="NE" id=7784>Tyrion</entity> and to keep him safe from those who would seek to use him against his former master . Before departing , <entity class="NE" id=7713>Brienne</entity> names the sword `` Oathkeeper '' and vows to find <entity class="NE" id=7796>Sansa</entity> , for the sake of <entity class="NE" id=7712>Jaime</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7829>Lady Catelyn</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7830>En</entity> route to the <entity class="NE" id=7831>Vale</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7796>Sansa</entity> accuses <entity class="NE" id=7833>Petyr Baelish</entity> of having <entity class="NE" id=7834>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> murdered . At first <entity class="NE" id=7835>Baelish</entity> evades the accusation , pointing out that he has been away for weeks and that Tyrion could be the perpetrator . <entity class="NE" id=7796>Sansa</entity> defends <entity class="NE" id=7784>Tyrion</entity> , with an innate certainty that he is innocent , and mentions that <entity class="NE" id=7835>Baelish</entity> is far too smart to trust a drunk with the scheme . Impressed with her instincts , <entity class="NE" id=7835>Baelish</entity> admits that <entity class="NE" id=7784>Tyrion</entity> is in fact innocent , and reveals <entity class="NE" id=7796>Sansa</entity> 's own part in <entity class="NE" id=7788>Joffrey</entity> 's death - <entity class="NE" id=7843>Ser Dontos</entity> ' necklace was in fact the murder weapon , and someone slipped a stone ( which was poisonous ) into <entity class="NE" id=7788>Joffrey</entity> 's wine . <entity class="NE" id=7796>Sansa</entity> is bewildered , because the Lannisters have done so much for <entity class="NE" id=7835>Baelish</entity> , including granting him the seat of <entity class="NE" id=7846>Harrenhal</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7835>Baelish</entity> confesses that while his friendship with the <entity class="NE" id=7848>Lannisters</entity> was fruitful , it is best to keep enemies confused and his absence from the wedding means that he will never be suspected . <entity class="NE" id=7796>Sansa</entity> declares that she does n't entirely believe him : he 's too clever to poison a king just to cause confusion . <entity class="NE" id=7835>Baelish</entity> is again impressed , and confirms that <entity class="NE" id=7788>Joffrey</entity> was simply too volatile ; a king like him as an ally was more a hindrance than a benefit . More importantly , though , <entity class="NE" id=7788>Joffrey</entity> 's death was something that his `` new friends '' wanted very much , and a gift is always helpful to help a new friendship `` grow strong . `` . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=7744>Wall</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=7854>Craster</entity> 's Keep , the mutinous deserters are still entrenched there , indulging themselves on the food stored there and raping <entity class="NE" id=7854>Craster</entity> 's wives . <entity class="NE" id=7855>Karl</entity> drinks wine from the skull of <entity class="NE" id=7856>Jeor Mormont</entity> , drunkenly bragging about himself and his skill as a hired killer back in <entity class="NE" id=7781>King</entity> 's Landing before ordering <entity class="NE" id=7858>Rast</entity> to `` feed the beast . '' At the same time , one of <entity class="NE" id=7854>Craster</entity> 's wives enters with <entity class="NE" id=7854>Craster</entity> 's last son , insisting the infant must be given as a 'gift to the gods . At <entity class="NE" id=7855>Karl</entity> 's orders , <entity class="NE" id=7858>Rast</entity> leaves the infant on a patch of open ground , then deals with the beast - <entity class="NE" id=7862>Ghost</entity> , who the mutineers have caged , and whom Rast taunts by withholding food and water from the direwolf . Suddenly , a snowstorm whips up and the temperature drops , causing the water <entity class="NE" id=7858>Rast</entity> was taunting <entity class="NE" id=7862>Ghost</entity> with to freeze . Recognizing the approach of <entity class="NE" id=7865>White Walkers</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7858>Rast</entity> flees . Nearby , <entity class="NE" id=7867>Bran Stark</entity> and his companions hear the child 's cries ; warging into <entity class="NE" id=7868>Summer</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7715>Bran</entity> goes to investigate , but <entity class="NE" id=7868>Summer</entity> falls into a trap just outside <entity class="NE" id=7854>Craster</entity> 's Keep . <entity class="NE" id=7871>Meera Meera</entity> , sensing danger , urges them to move on , but <entity class="NE" id=7715>Bran</entity> insists on trying to free <entity class="NE" id=7862>Ghost</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7868>Summer</entity> ; before they can , however , they are taken prisoner by the mutineers . Some of the deserters amuse themselves by tormenting <entity class="NE" id=7718>Hodor</entity> , while the others are taken to <entity class="NE" id=7855>Karl</entity> , who threatens to kill <entity class="NE" id=7717>Meera</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7716>Jojen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7716>Jojen</entity> is suddenly overcome by a seizure and falls to the floor while <entity class="NE" id=7717>Meera</entity> begs to be let go so she can help him . <entity class="NE" id=7855>Karl</entity> does so when <entity class="NE" id=7715>Bran</entity> reveals his true identity . In the <entity class="NE" id=7883>Lands</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=7884>Always Winter</entity> . Somewhere in the northernmost reaches of the world , a lone <entity class="NE" id=7885>White Walker</entity> rides its undead horse towards a shattered mountain , cradling <entity class="NE" id=7854>Craster</entity> 's last son in its arm . When it reaches the mountain , the <entity class="NE" id=7885>White Walker</entity> places the baby upon an altar of ice at the center of a ring of large icicles . On the other side , a line of dark-garbed <entity class="NE" id=7865>White Walkers</entity> watch the proceedings . After a moment , one of them strides forth and carefully picks up the wailing child , who swiftly calms . The <entity class="NE" id=7885>White Walker</entity> presses the nail of its index finger into the baby 's cheek . The sound of cracking ice can be heard as the child 's eyes turn a depthless , icy blue .
