A who 's who of honored guests turns out for <entity id=7296>Joffrey</entity> and <entity id=7297>Margaery</entity> 's wedding in <entity id=7298>King</entity> 's Landing . Meanwhile , <entity id=7299>Bronn</entity> gives a lesson to an unlikely pupil ; <entity id=7300>Bran</entity> 's vision helps map out his journey ; <entity id=7301>Stannis</entity> loses patience with <entity id=7302>Davos</entity> ; and <entity id=7303>Ramsay</entity> takes a perverse delight in his new pet . At <entity id=7304>Dragonstone</entity> . On the beach of <entity id=7305>Dragonstone</entity> , <entity id=7306>Melisandre</entity> presides over a public burning ceremony , setting three people chained to stakes ablaze as an offering to the <entity id=7307>Lord</entity> of <entity id=7308>Light</entity> . One of the condemned is <entity id=7309>Queen Selyse Baratheon</entity> 's own brother <entity id=7310>Axell Florent</entity> , condemned for his lack of faith in the <entity id=7311>Lord</entity> 's power . Watching the proceedings , <entity id=7312>Ser Davos Seaworth</entity> holds his tongue , though his disgust both for the ritual and <entity id=7313>Melisandre</entity> are plain . <entity id=7314>Melisandre</entity> is surprisingly silent throughout the proceedings ; it is <entity id=7315>Selyse</entity> who takes the greatest pleasure in the ritual . Afterwards , <entity id=7316>Stannis</entity> and <entity id=7317>Selyse</entity> eat dinner , with <entity id=7318>Melisandre</entity> as a guest at their table . The royal couple argue over their daughter , <entity id=7319>Princess Shireen Baratheon</entity> ; <entity id=7320>Selyse</entity> believes the girl 's disfigurement is a punishment from the <entity id=7321>Lord</entity> of <entity id=7322>Light</entity> , but <entity id=7323>Stannis</entity> angrily forbids his wife from trying to physically chastise their daughter for her perceived faults . <entity id=7324>Selyse</entity> switches tactics and suggests that <entity id=7325>Melisandre</entity> speak to <entity id=7326>Shireen</entity> . <entity id=7327>Stannis</entity> does n't protest , but <entity id=7328>Melisandre</entity> does n't look particularly interested in the task . Nonetheless , <entity id=7329>Melisandre</entity> does speak with <entity id=7330>Shireen</entity> , who heard the death of her uncle from her bedroom window , explaining in gentle yet matter-of-fact terms that the <entity id=7331>Faith</entity> of the Seven and its holy books are lies : Melisandre insists there are only two gods , the <entity id=7332>Lord</entity> of <entity id=7333>Light</entity> and the <entity id=7334>Great</entity> Other , constantly at war . When <entity id=7335>Shireen</entity> asks if there is any truth to the <entity id=7336>Faith</entity> 's belief in seven heavens and seven hells , <entity id=7337>Melisandre</entity> replies `` There is only one hell . the one we live in now '' . At the <entity id=7338>Dreadfort</entity> . In the forests surrounding the <entity id=7339>Dreadfort</entity> , the seat of <entity id=7340>House Bolton</entity> , <entity id=7341>Ramsay Snow</entity> hunts a peasant girl for his sport , accompanied by <entity id=7342>Theon Greyjoy</entity> ( whom <entity id=7343>Ramsay</entity> now addresses by his new name , <entity id=7344>Reek</entity> ) and <entity id=7345>Myranda</entity> , along with a pack of savage dogs . The girl is eventually brought down and torn to pieces by the dogs , much to <entity id=7346>Reek</entity> 's horror . Soon after , <entity id=7347>Roose Bolton</entity> arrives at the <entity id=7348>Dreadfort</entity> accompanied by a detachment of his army , including <entity id=7349>Locke</entity> and <entity id=7350>Roose</entity> 's new wife , <entity id=7351>Walda Bolton</entity> . <entity id=7352>Ramsay</entity> greets his father and his new step-mother ( as well as privately congratulating <entity id=7353>Locke</entity> for his maiming of the <entity id=7354>Kingslayer</entity> ) . <entity id=7355>Roose</entity> wants to see <entity id=7356>Ramsay</entity> 's captive Theon Greyjoy . <entity id=7357>Theon</entity> is brought to <entity id=7358>Roose</entity> 's chambers , where <entity id=7358>Roose</entity> is disgusted and angered to learn <entity id=7359>Ramsay</entity> has tortured and flayed <entity id=7357>Theon</entity> ; as <entity id=7360>Balon Greyjoy</entity> 's sole surviving male heir , <entity id=7357>Theon</entity> was a valuable hostage . <entity id=7361>Roose</entity> notes that while he has been named <entity id=7362>Warden</entity> of the <entity id=7363>North</entity> , <entity id=7364>Tywin Lannister</entity> will not help him reclaim the north from the ironborn , and he had intended on trading Theon for <entity id=7365>Moat Cailin</entity> , a strategically placed fortress on the border between the <entity id=7363>North</entity> and the <entity id=7366>Riverlands</entity> currently held by <entity id=7367>Greyjoy</entity> forces , preventing the main <entity id=7368>Bolton</entity> army from returning north . <entity id=7369>Ramsay</entity> retorts that he already sent terms and <entity id=7370>Balon</entity> refused him . <entity id=7371>Roose</entity> is furious that <entity id=7372>Ramsay</entity> did so without his consent , but <entity id=7372>Ramsay</entity> demonstrates that his actions have made <entity id=7373>Reek</entity> docile and unable to betray them . After ordering <entity id=7374>Reek</entity> to shave him , <entity id=7375>Ramsay</entity> cajoles him into admitting that <entity id=7376>Bran</entity> and <entity id=7377>Rickon Stark</entity> are still alive . <entity id=7378>Ramsay</entity> reminds his father that the boys are now heirs to <entity id=7379>House Stark</entity> 's rule of the <entity id=7380>North</entity> following <entity id=7381>Robb Stark</entity> 's death , and nearly all the <entity id=7382>Northerners</entity> , who are furious at <entity id=7383>House Bolton</entity> and <entity id=7384>House Frey</entity> 's treachery against the <entity id=7385>Starks</entity> , will rally behind <entity id=7386>Bran</entity> and <entity id=7387>Rickon</entity> rather than Roose if they learn the boys are alive . <entity id=7388>Ramsay</entity> , knowing how close Theon was to <entity id=7389>Robb</entity> , gleefully taunts him by revealing details of the <entity id=7390>Red Wedding</entity> , particularly relishing the fact that it was Roose who personally murdered <entity id=7389>Robb</entity> . Despite being clearly shaken to know the man he considered a brother is dead at the hands of his new masters , <entity id=7391>Theon</entity> does not openly react . <entity id=7392>Roose</entity> dispatches <entity id=7393>Locke</entity> with orders to find and kill <entity id=7394>Bran</entity> and <entity id=7395>Rickon</entity> ; <entity id=7396>Reek</entity> suggests that <entity id=7397>Jon Snow</entity> might either be sheltering the boys at <entity id=7398>Castle Black</entity> or at least may know where they have gone , while <entity id=7399>Ramsay</entity> advocates killing <entity id=7400>Jon</entity> as well , given that the fact he has <entity id=7401>Stark</entity> blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the <entity id=7402>Northeners</entity> will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge ( although harming <entity id=7400>Jon</entity> would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the <entity id=7403>Night's Watch</entity> and thus legally untouchable by the <entity id=7404>Seven Kingdoms</entity> ) . <entity id=7405>Roose</entity> gives <entity id=7406>Ramsay</entity> orders as well ; to take Theon and an army to <entity id=7407>Moat Cailin</entity> and reclaim the fortress from the <entity id=7408>Greyjoys</entity> . If he succeeds , <entity id=7409>Roose</entity> will give consideration to legitimizing <entity id=7410>Ramsay</entity> as a member of <entity id=7411>House Bolton</entity> . Beyond the <entity id=7412>Wall</entity> . We follow the point of view of a panting figure traveling through a dark , snow-covered forest . It kills a deer . Just as the figure makes its kill , it is revealed that the figure is <entity id=7413>Summer</entity> and that <entity id=7414>Bran Stark</entity> had been warging into <entity id=7413>Summer</entity> . <entity id=7415>Bran</entity> 's warging is interrupted by <entity id=7416>Meera Reed</entity> , who says that <entity id=7415>Bran</entity> had been gone for hours . <entity id=7417>Bran</entity> is not happy about having been snapped out of his warging , saying that he was eating . <entity id=7418>Jojen Jojen</entity> clarifies that <entity id=7419>Summer</entity> was eating and that what <entity id=7420>Bran</entity> can not gain sustenance from what Summer eats . <entity id=7421>Jojen</entity> and <entity id=7422>Meera</entity> also caution <entity id=7423>Bran</entity> that warging so long is dangerous for other reasons . Even though it allows Bran the mobility he lost when he was injured , <entity id=7424>Bran</entity> would become trapped , forgetting his friends , his family , his home , and even himself . And if <entity id=7425>Bran</entity> forgets himself , they all lose everything . The group breaks camp and continues traveling through the forest . They eventually come upon a weirwood tree . <entity id=7426>Bran</entity> has <entity id=7427>Hodor</entity> take him to the tree . <entity id=7428>Bran</entity> touches the tree just under the face carved into it and sees a vision . Several images rush to <entity id=7429>Bran</entity> 's mind , including swarms of crows , wights ( both human and horses ) , and the fall that paralyzed him . He also sees the Three-eyed raven taking flight in a darkened corridor and later land on a tree . <entity id=7430>Bran</entity> sees his father sharpening Ice , in the <entity id=7431>Black Cells</entity> , and being led to his execution ; the <entity id=7432>Red Keep</entity> abandoned and covered in snow ; and the shadow of a dragon flying over <entity id=7433>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity id=7434>Bran</entity> also sees several images of a different weirwood tree located on top of an otherwise barren mountain . During the vision , a gravely voice tells <entity id=7435>Bran</entity> to `` look for me beneath the tree . <entity id=7436>NORTH</entity> . '' <entity id=7437>Bran</entity> snaps out of his vision out of breath , but then matter-of-factly states , `` I know where we have to go . `` . At <entity id=7438>King</entity> 's Landing . Over a meal , <entity id=7439>Jaime</entity> and Tyrion discuss <entity id=7439>Jaime</entity> 's gilded steel hand , and he discloses to Tyrion that he can no longer fight , as all of his instincts are wrong using his left hand . <entity id=7440>Jaime</entity> is perturbed that people will find out that he can not fight so <entity id=7441>Tyrion</entity> tells him that he needs to train with his left hand with someone trustworthy in order to better protect the king , as the <entity id=7442>Lord Commander</entity> of the <entity id=7443>Kingsguard</entity> . <entity id=7444>Brienne</entity> presented before King Joffrey and <entity id=7445>Queen Margaery</entity> at their wedding . Later , <entity id=7446>Jaime</entity> waits in a courtyard by the sea for his training partner that <entity id=7447>Tyrion</entity> has arranged . <entity id=7448>Bronn</entity> emerges with two training swords . <entity id=7449>Jaime</entity> remarks that he has n't wielded a sparring sword since he was nine . As they commence training , <entity id=7450>Bronn</entity> uses his usual dirty tactics and gets the better of <entity id=7451>Jaime</entity> , teaching him not only to use his offhand , but encouraging him to fight dirtier . <entity id=7452>Tyrion</entity> finds <entity id=7453>Varys</entity> on his way to a breakfast celebration on the day of <entity id=7454>Joffrey</entity> 's wedding . <entity id=7455>Varys</entity> divulges that <entity id=7456>Shae</entity> has been spotted and that his sister , <entity id=7457>Cersei</entity> , has been notified . <entity id=7458>Varys</entity> then says that there is nothing he can do to protect <entity id=7459>Shae</entity> any longer in fear of <entity id=7460>Tywin Lannister</entity> , the <entity id=7461>Hand</entity> of the King , or Cersei finding out that he has been lying to them . <entity id=7462>Tyrion</entity> then says that <entity id=7463>Shae</entity> will not leave King 's Landing and is warned that <entity id=7464>Tywin</entity> has threatened to hang the next whore Tyrion is seen with . The dais set up for the royal wedding . At the breakfast celebration , <entity id=7465>Mace Tyrell</entity> gifts Joffrey a magnificent golden chalice with seven facets , one for each of the major houses in the <entity id=7466>Seven Kingdoms</entity> and wishes he and his daughter , <entity id=7467>Margaery Tyrell</entity> , a long and happy marriage . <entity id=7468>Joffrey</entity> graciously accepts . <entity id=7469>Cersei</entity> spots <entity id=7470>Shae</entity> and tells Tywin that she is <entity id=7471>Tyrion</entity> 's whore , and he commands for her to be sent to the Tower of the <entity id=7472>Hand</entity> before the wedding . <entity id=7473>Tyrion</entity> overhears this and looks vexed , but proceeds to approach <entity id=7474>Joffrey</entity> and <entity id=7475>Podrick Payne</entity> , <entity id=7473>Tyrion</entity> 's squire , presents him with the <entity id=7476>Lives of Four Kings</entity> , a book detailing the reigns of four kings by <entity id=7477>Grand Maester Kaeth</entity> . <entity id=7478>Joffrey</entity> accepts the gift but his sincerity seems questionable . A member of the <entity id=7479>Kingsguard</entity> then presents a <entity id=7480>Valyrian</entity> steel sword and <entity id=7481>Tywin</entity> tells him that it is one of two swords of its kind in the capital , and <entity id=7482>Joffrey</entity> rushes to wield it . He promptly begins to slash at <entity id=7483>Tyrion</entity> 's gift despite its rarity , and then asks for suggestions on its name from guests in attendance . He settle on the name <entity id=7484>Widow</entity> 's Wail . After the breakfast , <entity id=7485>Tyrion</entity> is visited in his chambers by <entity id=7486>Shae</entity> and he informs her that there is a ship waiting for her bound for <entity id=7487>Pentos</entity> and that their `` friendship '' is at an end . <entity id=7488>Shae</entity> pleads to stay , but <entity id=7489>Tyrion</entity> says he is married and it is too dangerous for her to stay . <entity id=7490>Joffrey</entity> is poisoned and killed . When <entity id=7491>Bronn</entity> enters and tries to escort her out , she slaps him and runs away . When <entity id=7492>Tyrion</entity> later asks <entity id=7493>Bronn</entity> if she is gone , he says that she boarded the ship . When <entity id=7494>Tyrion</entity> asks if he saw it sail away , <entity id=7495>Bronn</entity> assures him that no one has been following him while escorting her , that she is gone and no one knows about it except the two of them and <entity id=7496>Varys</entity> . He then advises <entity id=7497>Tyrion</entity> to go and drink until it feels like he did the right thing . <entity id=7498>Joffrey</entity> and <entity id=7499>Margaery</entity> 's wedding ceremony takes place in the <entity id=7500>Great Sept</entity> of <entity id=7501>Baelor</entity> conducted by the <entity id=7502>High Septon</entity> and they are wed in front of gods and men . At his wedding feast , King Joffrey speaks to the crowd about contemplating history . Out of a large golden lion , five dwarves ride out , representing <entity id=7503>Joffrey</entity> , <entity id=7504>Renly Baratheon</entity> , <entity id=7505>Stannis Baratheon</entity> , <entity id=7506>Robb Stark</entity> , and <entity id=7507>Balon Greyjoy</entity> , each of the five kings in the War of the <entity id=7508>Five Kings</entity> . The dwarves put on a performance , jousting , fighting , and making crude sexual acts . <entity id=7509>Joffrey</entity> , his brother <entity id=7510>Tommen</entity> , and <entity id=7511>Cersei</entity> laugh at the performance . The <entity id=7512>Tyrells</entity> ( <entity id=7513>Margaery</entity> , <entity id=7514>Olenna</entity> , <entity id=7515>Mace</entity> , and <entity id=7516>Loras</entity> ) , as well as <entity id=7517>Varys</entity> , <entity id=7518>Prince Oberyn</entity> , <entity id=7519>Tywin</entity> , <entity id=7520>Tyrion</entity> , and <entity id=7521>Sansa Stark</entity> , make little effort to hide their disgust . <entity id=7522>Loras</entity> leaves in anger after watching the crude depiction of his deceased lover <entity id=7523>Renly</entity> ( riding a mount resembling <entity id=7522>Loras</entity> ) , and <entity id=7524>Sansa</entity> looks on in obvious grief when the dwarf playing her brother <entity id=7525>Robb</entity> is killed after having his wolf 's head knocked off . <entity id=7526>Joffrey</entity> expresses his delight with the play and prepares to give the champion dwarf a purse but then mockingly suggests that <entity id=7527>Tyrion</entity> fight him as well . <entity id=7528>Tyrion</entity> cleverly counters this jape by suggesting that <entity id=7529>Joffrey</entity> should fight instead and show the same bravery he displayed at the <entity id=7530>Battle</entity> of the <entity id=7531>Blackwater</entity> , cautioning his nephew to be careful as the champion dwarf is `` clearly mad with lust '' and it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night . This draws a few stifled chuckles from their guests . <entity id=7532>Enraged</entity> and humiliated that his uncle outwitted him in front of all his wedding guests , <entity id=7533>Joffrey</entity> petulantly pours wine over <entity id=7534>Tyrion</entity> 's head and orders him to serve him wine as his cupbearer . <entity id=7535>Tyrion</entity> approaches <entity id=7536>Joffrey</entity> , who then purposely drops the goblet and kicks it under the table . <entity id=7537>Sansa</entity> hands the goblet to <entity id=7538>Tyrion</entity> , and he fills it with wine and hands it back to <entity id=7539>Joffrey</entity> . The king demands that <entity id=7540>Tyrion</entity> kneel before him but <entity id=7540>Tyrion</entity> refuses . <entity id=7541>Margaery</entity> interrupts the tense moment and says it is time to cut the pigeon pie . <entity id=7542>Joffrey</entity> hands the goblet to <entity id=7543>Margaery</entity> , who then places it at the edge of the table near her grandmother <entity id=7544>Olenna</entity> . <entity id=7545>Joffrey</entity> draws his new sword , cuts the pie , and several white doves fly out . <entity id=7546>Cersei</entity> cries over her sons murder . <entity id=7547>Sansa</entity> and <entity id=7548>Tyrion</entity> attempt to leave the feast , while <entity id=7549>Margaery</entity> serves <entity id=7550>Joffrey</entity> a piece of pie . <entity id=7551>Joffrey</entity> commands <entity id=7552>Tyrion</entity> to serve him wine to wash down the pie . <entity id=7553>Tyrion</entity> hands the goblet to <entity id=7554>Joffrey</entity> and he quickly drinks all of it . <entity id=7555>Joffrey</entity> tries to speak , but begins coughing . He grabs his throat , and <entity id=7556>Margaery</entity> and <entity id=7557>Olenna</entity> exclaim that he is choking and needs help . <entity id=7558>Joffrey</entity> collapses face down and begins vomiting and convulsing . <entity id=7559>Jaime</entity> and <entity id=7560>Cersei</entity> rush in and turn <entity id=7561>Joffrey</entity> over on his back . <entity id=7562>Dontos Dontos</entity> suddenly approaches <entity id=7563>Sansa</entity> from behind and says she must come with him quickly , and she does . <entity id=7564>Joffrey</entity> points an accusatory finger in <entity id=7565>Tyrion</entity> 's direction , as he examines the wine goblet ( though it is not made clear if <entity id=7564>Joffrey</entity> is accusing <entity id=7565>Tyrion</entity> or merely the wine ) . <entity id=7566>Joffrey</entity> 's eyes turn red , blood runs from his nose , he stops convulsing , and dies . <entity id=7567>Cersei</entity> sobs with grief and orders the <entity id=7568>Kingsguard</entity> to seize <entity id=7569>Tyrion</entity> for the poisoning of her son .
