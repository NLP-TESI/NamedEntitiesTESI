<entity id=8094>Stannis</entity> and <entity id=8095>Davos</entity> set sail with a new strategy . <entity id=8096>Dany</entity> meets with supplicants . <entity id=8097>Tyrion</entity> faces down his father in the throne room . At the <entity id=8098>Dreadfort</entity> . <entity id=8099>Yara Yara</entity> prepares her troops for their assault on the <entity id=8100>Dreadfort</entity> to rescue her brother , <entity id=8101>Theon</entity> . She reads the letter sent by <entity id=8102>Ramsay Snow</entity> , threatening to flay all ironborn who do not leave the <entity id=8103>North</entity> . While <entity id=8104>Ramsay</entity> has rather violent sex with <entity id=8105>Myranda</entity> , <entity id=8106>Yara</entity> and her troops land and scale the walls of the castle . They quietly take out the guards as they search for Theon . Interrogating a guard , <entity id=8107>Yara</entity> learns of <entity id=8108>Theon</entity> 's location which is the dog kennels , and <entity id=8107>Yara</entity> then kills the guard , despite promising not to . There , the ironborn and <entity id=8109>Yara</entity> see Theon sitting in a cage . <entity id=8110>Yara</entity> opens the cage , but Theon refuses to go with her , believing it is another cruel trick played by <entity id=8111>Ramsay</entity> . <entity id=8112>Ramsay</entity> and several <entity id=8113>Bolton</entity> troops enter and a fight ensues , with several <entity id=8113>Bolton</entity> and <entity id=8114>Greyjoy</entity> soldiers killed . <entity id=8115>Theon</entity> tells Yara his name has always been <entity id=8116>Reek</entity> , bites her , and cowers in his cage . <entity id=8117>Ramsay</entity> releases the hounds and <entity id=8118>Yara</entity> is forced to retreat to her ship . When one of the ironmen asks about Theon , <entity id=8119>Yara</entity> says Theon is `` dead . `` . <entity id=8120>Ramsay</entity> allows <entity id=8121>Reek</entity> to take a bath , as a reward for his loyalty . <entity id=8122>Reek</entity> fears the bath is another trick but <entity id=8123>Ramsay</entity> assures him it is not . While <entity id=8124>Reek</entity> bathes , <entity id=8125>Ramsay</entity> now plans to assault <entity id=8126>Moat Cailin</entity> and needs <entity id=8124>Reek</entity> to pretend to be someone he is n't : Theon <entity id=8127>Greyjoy</entity> . At <entity id=8128>King</entity> 's Landing . At a meeting of the <entity id=8129>Small Council</entity> , <entity id=8130>Tywin</entity> informs the councilors that <entity id=8131>Tyrion</entity> 's trial will begin that afternoon . <entity id=8132>Lord Lord</entity> informs <entity id=8133>Tywin</entity> that the <entity id=8134>Hound</entity> has been spotted in the <entity id=8135>Riverlands</entity> , and <entity id=8133>Tywin</entity> orders a bounty on his head . <entity id=8136>Varys</entity> also informs the council of <entity id=8137>Daenerys</entity> 's conquest of <entity id=8138>Meereen</entity> , and <entity id=8139>Tywin</entity> decides to take measures to prevent her from launching an invasion . In the dungeon , <entity id=8140>Jaime</entity> has <entity id=8141>Tyrion</entity> shackled and brought into the throne room to begin his trial . King <entity id=8142>Tommen</entity> recuses himself from the trial , appointing his grandfather <entity id=8143>Tywin</entity> , <entity id=8144>Prince Oberyn Martell</entity> , and <entity id=8145>Lord Mace Tyrell</entity> as judges . Several witnesses are called for the prosecution , including <entity id=8146>Ser Meryn Trant</entity> , <entity id=8147>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> , <entity id=8148>Queen Regent Cersei</entity> , and <entity id=8149>Varys</entity> , all of whom give testimony backing the accusations against <entity id=8150>Tyrion</entity> . <entity id=8151>Varys</entity> testifies at <entity id=8152>Tyrion</entity> 's trial . At recess , <entity id=8153>Jaime</entity> asks <entity id=8154>Tywin</entity> to spare <entity id=8155>Tyrion</entity> , offering to break his oath to the <entity id=8156>Kingsguard</entity> and return to <entity id=8157>Casterly Rock</entity> , to be his heir . <entity id=8158>Tywin</entity> accepts , telling Jaime that <entity id=8159>Tyrion</entity> will be allowed to join the <entity id=8160>Night</entity> 's Watch after being found guilty of <entity id=8161>Joffrey</entity> 's murder , provided he pleads for mercy . Before the recess ends , <entity id=8162>Jaime</entity> speaks with <entity id=8163>Tyrion</entity> and urges him to do so . <entity id=8164>Tyrion</entity> is deeply distrustful of the offer , remarking that <entity id=8165>Eddard Stark</entity> was promised the same thing and yet still lost his head , but <entity id=8166>Jaime</entity> pleads with his brother to trust him , insisting that their father will keep his word . Returning to the trial , <entity id=8167>Tywin</entity> orders the next witness to testify : <entity id=8168>Shae</entity> . She testifies that <entity id=8169>Tyrion</entity> and <entity id=8170>Sansa</entity> planned <entity id=8171>Joffrey</entity> 's murder together , claiming that <entity id=8170>Sansa</entity> wanted vengeance for the murder of her father , mother , and brother . She tells the judges of <entity id=8172>Tyrion</entity> 's sexual desires , embarrassing him in front of the crowd . Before she can continue , <entity id=8173>Tyrion</entity> , enraged beyond sense , angrily demands that he be allowed to confess his crimes . He angrily roars about how he saved <entity id=8174>King</entity> 's Landing from <entity id=8175>Stannis Baratheon</entity> 's forces and says he should 've allowed <entity id=8176>Stannis</entity> to kill everyone in <entity id=8174>King</entity> 's Landing , much to the horror and disgust of the people in the court . <entity id=8177>Tyrion</entity> then claims to be guilty . <entity id=8178>Tywin</entity> assumes that he is guilty for murdering King <entity id=8179>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> . <entity id=8180>Tyrion</entity> denies this , saying he is guilty of a `` far more monstrous crime . I am guilty of being a dwarf ! '' <entity id=8181>Tywin</entity> scoffs at <entity id=8182>Tyrion</entity> 's claims and says he is not on trial for being a dwarf . <entity id=8183>Tyrion</entity> angrily says he has been on trial for his entire life as a dwarf . <entity id=8184>Tywin</entity> asks if he has nothing to say in his defense . <entity id=8185>Tyrion</entity> then says he has nothing to say in his defense `` but only this . '' He then reveals his true feelings about <entity id=8186>Joffrey</entity> , denying guilt in the king 's murder but saying he wished to have killed <entity id=8186>Joffrey</entity> himself . <entity id=8187>Tyrion</entity> then turns his full fury towards <entity id=8188>Cersei</entity> and says that watching her `` vicious bastard '' of a son die gave him more relief than `` a thousand lying whores . '' He then turns around to the court and roars that he wishes to have become the monster they thought he was and would have gladly give his life to watch everyone die from drinking poison . This enrages everyone in the court and <entity id=8189>Tywin</entity> orders <entity id=8190>Ser Meryn</entity> to escort <entity id=8191>Tyrion</entity> back to the dungeons . Before he can be escorted out , <entity id=8192>Tyrion</entity> bellows that he will not lose his life for a crime he did not commit and , knowing that he will get no justice from the court , demands a trial by combat . In <entity id=8193>Braavos</entity> . <entity id=8194>Stannis Stannis</entity> and <entity id=8195>Ser Davos</entity> visit the <entity id=8196>Iron Bank</entity> of <entity id=8197>Braavos</entity> in hopes of securing funds to aid <entity id=8198>Stannis</entity> ' war effort . At first <entity id=8199>Tycho Nestoris</entity> , a representative from the bank , rejects their request , but <entity id=8200>Davos</entity> entreats him and points out that funding <entity id=8201>Stannis</entity> is the best way they could possibly get the gold they loaned to <entity id=8202>Tywin Lannister</entity> back . The <entity id=8203>Bank</entity> agrees to lend them gold , and <entity id=8204>Davos</entity> uses it to once again recruit his old pirate friend <entity id=8205>Salladhor Saan</entity> to <entity id=8206>Stannis</entity> ' cause . In <entity id=8207>Meereen</entity> . <entity id=8208>Drogon</entity> toasting goats On one sunny day outside of <entity id=8209>Meereen</entity> , a goat herder and his son are peacefully tending the goats on a hill while the son throws rocks to pass the time . Suddenly , <entity id=8210>Drogon</entity> ( now the size of a horse ) appears and burns the field and kills a flock of goats while taking one with him . The goat herder travels to <entity id=8211>Meereen</entity> to visit the queen and lays the charred remains of his flock before <entity id=8212>Daenerys</entity> , hoping to not anger the queen and believes it to be punishment . <entity id=8213>Daenerys</entity> apologizes about <entity id=8214>Drogon</entity> 's actions and promises to pay back three times the worth of his flock . After he departs , <entity id=8215>Hizdahr zo Loraq</entity> presents his petition : the right to bury his father 's remains in the Temple of the <entity id=8216>Graces</entity> , as he was one of the <entity id=8217>Meereenese Great Masters</entity> crucified on <entity id=8218>Daenerys</entity> 's orders . She counters that he was one of the masters that crucified the 163 children . <entity id=8219>Loraq</entity> reveals that his father actually spoke out against the crucifixion of the slave children but was overruled , but later was killed due to <entity id=8220>Daenerys</entity> 's judgment anyway . Somewhat mollified , <entity id=8221>Daenerys</entity> allows him to bury his father . As he leaves , <entity id=8222>Daenerys</entity> asks how many more supplicants are waiting ; <entity id=8223>Missandei</entity> answers that there are over 200 more .
