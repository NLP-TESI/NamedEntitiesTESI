<entity class="NE" id=8063>Stannis</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8064>Davos</entity> set sail with a new strategy . <entity class="NE" id=8065>Dany</entity> meets with supplicants . <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> faces down his father in the throne room . At the <entity class="NE" id=8067>Dreadfort</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8068>Yara Yara</entity> prepares her troops for their assault on the <entity class="NE" id=8067>Dreadfort</entity> to rescue her brother , <entity class="NE" id=8070>Theon</entity> . She reads the letter sent by <entity class="NE" id=8071>Ramsay Snow</entity> , threatening to flay all ironborn who do not leave the <entity class="NE" id=8072>North</entity> . While <entity class="NE" id=8073>Ramsay</entity> has rather violent sex with <entity class="NE" id=8074>Myranda</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8075>Yara</entity> and her troops land and scale the walls of the castle . They quietly take out the guards as they search for Theon . Interrogating a guard , <entity class="NE" id=8075>Yara</entity> learns of <entity class="NE" id=8070>Theon</entity> 's location which is the dog kennels , and <entity class="NE" id=8075>Yara</entity> then kills the guard , despite promising not to . There , the ironborn and <entity class="NE" id=8075>Yara</entity> see Theon sitting in a cage . <entity class="NE" id=8075>Yara</entity> opens the cage , but Theon refuses to go with her , believing it is another cruel trick played by <entity class="NE" id=8073>Ramsay</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8073>Ramsay</entity> and several <entity class="NE" id=8082>Bolton</entity> troops enter and a fight ensues , with several <entity class="NE" id=8082>Bolton</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8083>Greyjoy</entity> soldiers killed . <entity class="NE" id=8070>Theon</entity> tells Yara his name has always been <entity class="NE" id=8085>Reek</entity> , bites her , and cowers in his cage . <entity class="NE" id=8073>Ramsay</entity> releases the hounds and <entity class="NE" id=8075>Yara</entity> is forced to retreat to her ship . When one of the ironmen asks about Theon , <entity class="NE" id=8075>Yara</entity> says Theon is `` dead . `` . <entity class="NE" id=8073>Ramsay</entity> allows <entity class="NE" id=8085>Reek</entity> to take a bath , as a reward for his loyalty . <entity class="NE" id=8085>Reek</entity> fears the bath is another trick but <entity class="NE" id=8073>Ramsay</entity> assures him it is not . While <entity class="NE" id=8085>Reek</entity> bathes , <entity class="NE" id=8073>Ramsay</entity> now plans to assault <entity class="NE" id=8095>Moat Cailin</entity> and needs <entity class="NE" id=8085>Reek</entity> to pretend to be someone he is n't : Theon <entity class="NE" id=8083>Greyjoy</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=8097>King</entity> 's Landing . At a meeting of the <entity class="NE" id=8098>Small Council</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> informs the councilors that <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> 's trial will begin that afternoon . <entity class="NE" id=8101>Lord Lord</entity> informs <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> that the <entity class="NE" id=8103>Hound</entity> has been spotted in the <entity class="NE" id=8104>Riverlands</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> orders a bounty on his head . <entity class="NE" id=8105>Varys</entity> also informs the council of <entity class="NE" id=8106>Daenerys</entity> 's conquest of <entity class="NE" id=8107>Meereen</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> decides to take measures to prevent her from launching an invasion . In the dungeon , <entity class="NE" id=8109>Jaime</entity> has <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> shackled and brought into the throne room to begin his trial . King <entity class="NE" id=8111>Tommen</entity> recuses himself from the trial , appointing his grandfather <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8113>Prince Oberyn Martell</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=8114>Lord Mace Tyrell</entity> as judges . Several witnesses are called for the prosecution , including <entity class="NE" id=8115>Ser Meryn Trant</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8116>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8117>Queen Regent Cersei</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=8105>Varys</entity> , all of whom give testimony backing the accusations against <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8105>Varys</entity> testifies at <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> 's trial . At recess , <entity class="NE" id=8109>Jaime</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> to spare <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> , offering to break his oath to the <entity class="NE" id=8125>Kingsguard</entity> and return to <entity class="NE" id=8126>Casterly Rock</entity> , to be his heir . <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> accepts , telling Jaime that <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> will be allowed to join the <entity class="NE" id=8129>Night</entity> 's Watch after being found guilty of <entity class="NE" id=8130>Joffrey</entity> 's murder , provided he pleads for mercy . Before the recess ends , <entity class="NE" id=8109>Jaime</entity> speaks with <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> and urges him to do so . <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> is deeply distrustful of the offer , remarking that <entity class="NE" id=8134>Eddard Stark</entity> was promised the same thing and yet still lost his head , but <entity class="NE" id=8109>Jaime</entity> pleads with his brother to trust him , insisting that their father will keep his word . Returning to the trial , <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> orders the next witness to testify : <entity class="NE" id=8137>Shae</entity> . She testifies that <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8139>Sansa</entity> planned <entity class="NE" id=8130>Joffrey</entity> 's murder together , claiming that <entity class="NE" id=8139>Sansa</entity> wanted vengeance for the murder of her father , mother , and brother . She tells the judges of <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> 's sexual desires , embarrassing him in front of the crowd . Before she can continue , <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> , enraged beyond sense , angrily demands that he be allowed to confess his crimes . He angrily roars about how he saved <entity class="NE" id=8097>King</entity> 's Landing from <entity class="NE" id=8144>Stannis Baratheon</entity> 's forces and says he should 've allowed <entity class="NE" id=8063>Stannis</entity> to kill everyone in <entity class="NE" id=8097>King</entity> 's Landing , much to the horror and disgust of the people in the court . <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> then claims to be guilty . <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> assumes that he is guilty for murdering King <entity class="NE" id=8148>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> denies this , saying he is guilty of a `` far more monstrous crime . I am guilty of being a dwarf ! '' <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> scoffs at <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> 's claims and says he is not on trial for being a dwarf . <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> angrily says he has been on trial for his entire life as a dwarf . <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> asks if he has nothing to say in his defense . <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> then says he has nothing to say in his defense `` but only this . '' He then reveals his true feelings about <entity class="NE" id=8130>Joffrey</entity> , denying guilt in the king 's murder but saying he wished to have killed <entity class="NE" id=8130>Joffrey</entity> himself . <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> then turns his full fury towards <entity class="NE" id=8157>Cersei</entity> and says that watching her `` vicious bastard '' of a son die gave him more relief than `` a thousand lying whores . '' He then turns around to the court and roars that he wishes to have become the monster they thought he was and would have gladly give his life to watch everyone die from drinking poison . This enrages everyone in the court and <entity class="NE" id=8099>Tywin</entity> orders <entity class="NE" id=8159>Ser Meryn</entity> to escort <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> back to the dungeons . Before he can be escorted out , <entity class="NE" id=8066>Tyrion</entity> bellows that he will not lose his life for a crime he did not commit and , knowing that he will get no justice from the court , demands a trial by combat . In <entity class="NE" id=8162>Braavos</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8163>Stannis Stannis</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8164>Ser Davos</entity> visit the <entity class="NE" id=8165>Iron Bank</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=8162>Braavos</entity> in hopes of securing funds to aid <entity class="NE" id=8063>Stannis</entity> ' war effort . At first <entity class="NE" id=8168>Tycho Nestoris</entity> , a representative from the bank , rejects their request , but <entity class="NE" id=8064>Davos</entity> entreats him and points out that funding <entity class="NE" id=8063>Stannis</entity> is the best way they could possibly get the gold they loaned to <entity class="NE" id=8171>Tywin Lannister</entity> back . The <entity class="NE" id=8172>Bank</entity> agrees to lend them gold , and <entity class="NE" id=8064>Davos</entity> uses it to once again recruit his old pirate friend <entity class="NE" id=8174>Salladhor Saan</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=8063>Stannis</entity> ' cause . In <entity class="NE" id=8107>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8177>Drogon</entity> toasting goats On one sunny day outside of <entity class="NE" id=8107>Meereen</entity> , a goat herder and his son are peacefully tending the goats on a hill while the son throws rocks to pass the time . Suddenly , <entity class="NE" id=8177>Drogon</entity> ( now the size of a horse ) appears and burns the field and kills a flock of goats while taking one with him . The goat herder travels to <entity class="NE" id=8107>Meereen</entity> to visit the queen and lays the charred remains of his flock before <entity class="NE" id=8106>Daenerys</entity> , hoping to not anger the queen and believes it to be punishment . <entity class="NE" id=8106>Daenerys</entity> apologizes about <entity class="NE" id=8177>Drogon</entity> 's actions and promises to pay back three times the worth of his flock . After he departs , <entity class="NE" id=8184>Hizdahr zo Loraq</entity> presents his petition : the right to bury his father 's remains in the Temple of the <entity class="NE" id=8185>Graces</entity> , as he was one of the <entity class="NE" id=8186>Meereenese Great Masters</entity> crucified on <entity class="NE" id=8106>Daenerys</entity> 's orders . She counters that he was one of the masters that crucified the 163 children . <entity class="NE" id=8188>Loraq</entity> reveals that his father actually spoke out against the crucifixion of the slave children but was overruled , but later was killed due to <entity class="NE" id=8106>Daenerys</entity> 's judgment anyway . Somewhat mollified , <entity class="NE" id=8106>Daenerys</entity> allows him to bury his father . As he leaves , <entity class="NE" id=8106>Daenerys</entity> asks how many more supplicants are waiting ; <entity class="NE" id=8192>Missandei</entity> answers that there are over 200 more .
