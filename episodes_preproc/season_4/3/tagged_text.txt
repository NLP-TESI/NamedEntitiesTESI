In the frenzied aftermath of the royal wedding , <entity class="NE" id=7570>Tyrion</entity> gets a visit from a loyal subject . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=7571>Tywin</entity> offers to work for the common good with a presumed enemy ; <entity class="NE" id=7572>Sam</entity> takes stock of the personnel at <entity class="NE" id=7573>Castle Black</entity> ; the <entity class="NE" id=7574>Hound</entity> gives another life lesson to <entity class="NE" id=7575>Arya</entity> ; and <entity class="NE" id=7576>Daenerys</entity> makes a decision outside the walls of <entity class="NE" id=7577>Meereen</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=7578>King</entity> 's Landing . With <entity class="NE" id=7579>King Joffrey</entity> dead , <entity class="NE" id=7580>Cersei</entity> mourns the death of her elder son with the heir apparent and , still holding <entity class="NE" id=7581>Joffrey</entity> in her arms , demands that <entity class="NE" id=7582>Sansa Stark</entity> be found . Her father seals the capital , so no one can leave . <entity class="NE" id=7583>Prince Prince</entity> , in the <entity class="NE" id=7584>Great Sept</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=7585>Baelor</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7586>Tywin Lannister</entity> , also present , immediately begins instructing the young prince on the qualities of a good king . As <entity class="NE" id=7587>Tywin</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7588>Tommen</entity> leave , <entity class="NE" id=7589>Jaime</entity> enters to see <entity class="NE" id=7590>Cersei</entity> calling for the death of the accused Tyrion and his wife , <entity class="NE" id=7591>Sansa Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7592>Jaime</entity> sends the septon and septas away so he can be alone with <entity class="NE" id=7593>Cersei</entity> . He tries to comfort her through his affections . She refuses initially , but <entity class="NE" id=7594>Jaime</entity> is aggressive . <entity class="NE" id=7595>Cersei</entity> insists that the sept during a private viewing of their son 's corpse is a highly inappropriate place for sex , and asks <entity class="NE" id=7596>Jaime</entity> to stop , saying `` It is n't right , it is n't right . '' and <entity class="NE" id=7597>Jaime</entity> refuses to stop , saying , `` I do n't care , I do n't care . `` . They then have sex next to their dead son 's corpse . A flashback to the wedding reveals <entity class="NE" id=7598>Sansa</entity> escaping with <entity class="NE" id=7599>Ser Dontos Hollard</entity> from <entity class="NE" id=7600>King</entity> 's Landing to a ship off the coast . As <entity class="NE" id=7601>Sansa</entity> is taken aboard , she is greeted by <entity class="NE" id=7602>Lord Petyr</entity> `` Littlefinger '' <entity class="NE" id=7603>Baelish</entity> . He remembers that he still owes <entity class="NE" id=7604>Dontos</entity> his fee , but <entity class="NE" id=7605>Baelish</entity> has two men kill him with crossbows . He explains to Sansa that <entity class="NE" id=7606>Ser Dontos</entity> was a drunken fool and an unreliable ally who only helped <entity class="NE" id=7607>Sansa</entity> for money and would turn her in for money . To prove his point , he shows that the priceless necklace <entity class="NE" id=7608>Dontos</entity> gave her was actually made a few weeks ago on <entity class="NE" id=7609>Baelish</entity> 's orders . <entity class="NE" id=7610>Sansa</entity> is confused and horrified , but <entity class="NE" id=7611>Baelish</entity> promises to keep her safe . <entity class="NE" id=7612>Tywin</entity> interrupts <entity class="NE" id=7613>Oberyn Martell</entity> and his group sex act with <entity class="NE" id=7614>Ellaria Sand</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7615>Olyvar</entity> to discuss <entity class="NE" id=7616>Tyrion</entity> 's up-coming trial for the murder of <entity class="NE" id=7617>Joffrey</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7618>Tywin</entity> brings up <entity class="NE" id=7619>Oberyn</entity> 's knowledge of poisons and the link between that and <entity class="NE" id=7620>Joffrey</entity> 's death – as some say the King was poisoned – and wonders whether <entity class="NE" id=7619>Oberyn</entity> had helped <entity class="NE" id=7621>Tyrion</entity> . The topic changes to the murder of <entity class="NE" id=7622>Oberyn</entity> 's sister <entity class="NE" id=7623>Elia</entity> by <entity class="NE" id=7624>Tywin</entity> 's `` pet , '' the <entity class="NE" id=7625>Mountain</entity> , during the Sack of <entity class="NE" id=7626>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=7627>Tywin</entity> denies ordering her death , but promises to arrange a meeting between <entity class="NE" id=7628>Oberyn</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=7629>Mountain</entity> so he can have his justice . He also offers <entity class="NE" id=7630>Oberyn</entity> a position on the <entity class="NE" id=7631>Small Council</entity> , if <entity class="NE" id=7630>Oberyn</entity> agrees to be the third judge at <entity class="NE" id=7632>Tyrion</entity> 's trial . He explains that he is eager to bring <entity class="NE" id=7633>Dorne</entity> back into the fold , wanting to unite the <entity class="NE" id=7634>Seven Kingdoms</entity> against more obvious threats ; the <entity class="NE" id=7635>Greyjoys</entity> are in rebellion , a Wildling army is advancing on the <entity class="NE" id=7636>Wall</entity> , and there is a Targaryen girl in the <entity class="NE" id=7637>East</entity> with a powerful army and three dragons , who will eventually threaten <entity class="NE" id=7638>Westeros</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7639>Tywin</entity> observes that only the <entity class="NE" id=7640>Dornish</entity> successfully resisted <entity class="NE" id=7641>Aegon Targaryen</entity> 's dragons during his invasion of <entity class="NE" id=7642>Westeros</entity> three centuries ago ; <entity class="NE" id=7643>Oberyn</entity> dryly notes it must be hard for <entity class="NE" id=7639>Tywin</entity> to admit he needs the <entity class="NE" id=7640>Dornish</entity> for help . <entity class="NE" id=7644>Tyrion</entity> is in a cell in <entity class="NE" id=7645>King</entity> 's Landing . He is visited by his squire , <entity class="NE" id=7646>Podrick Payne</entity> , who has smuggled in some food and other items for him . <entity class="NE" id=7647>Pod</entity> has been asked to compile a list of <entity class="NE" id=7648>Tyrion</entity> 's witnesses . He names his wife , <entity class="NE" id=7649>Sansa</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=7650>Pod</entity> informs him that she disappeared moments after <entity class="NE" id=7651>Joffrey</entity> 's death . He can not speak to <entity class="NE" id=7652>Bronn</entity> either because , as a close associate of <entity class="NE" id=7653>Tyrion</entity> , he is also under investigation . <entity class="NE" id=7654>Pod</entity> confirms that there has been no word of <entity class="NE" id=7655>Shae</entity> , which <entity class="NE" id=7656>Tyrion</entity> takes as good news . <entity class="NE" id=7657>Tyrion</entity> then asks to speak with <entity class="NE" id=7658>Jaime</entity> . He also warns <entity class="NE" id=7659>Pod</entity> to be aware of his surroundings and watch out for `` They , '' `` They '' being the spies of <entity class="NE" id=7660>Tywin</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7661>Cersei</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7662>Varys</entity> or more or less anyone else . He opines that many people had a motive for killing <entity class="NE" id=7663>Joffrey</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7664>Cersei</entity> is the only person he rules out . He urges <entity class="NE" id=7665>Pod</entity> to get out of <entity class="NE" id=7666>King</entity> 's Landing as he would be in much danger due to his close relations with <entity class="NE" id=7667>Tyrion</entity> , especially after refusing to testify against <entity class="NE" id=7667>Tyrion</entity> , despite the offer of a knighthood . As <entity class="NE" id=7668>Pod</entity> is about to leave , <entity class="NE" id=7669>Tyrion</entity> calls him back and tells him that `` there has never lived a more loyal squire . `` . In the <entity class="NE" id=7670>Riverlands</entity> . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=7671>Arya Stark</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=7672>Hound</entity> , crossing the <entity class="NE" id=7673>Riverlands</entity> , are spotted by a farmer and his young daughter while making their way to the <entity class="NE" id=7674>Vale</entity> where <entity class="NE" id=7675>Arya</entity> can be ransomed to her `` rich '' aunt , <entity class="NE" id=7676>Lysa Tully</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7677>Arya</entity> quickly fabricates a story that the <entity class="NE" id=7678>Hound</entity> and she are father and daughter , with <entity class="NE" id=7679>Clegane</entity> as a knight in service of <entity class="HSE" id=7680>House Tully</entity> . The farmer believes it and allows the pair to stay the night in his home and share a meal . <entity class="NE" id=7681>Famished</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7682>Arya</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=7683>Hound</entity> scarf the food down hastily . <entity class="NE" id=7684>Arya</entity> wakes the following morning to hear the farmer 's daughter screaming . <entity class="NE" id=7685>Clegane</entity> has assaulted the farmer and taken his silver . Confused and horrified , <entity class="NE" id=7686>Arya</entity> demands to know why <entity class="NE" id=7687>Clegane</entity> did that . He simply states , `` a dead man does n't need his silver , '' claiming the farmer is weak and he and his daughter will not survive the upcoming winter . At <entity class="NE" id=7688>Dragonstone</entity> . On Dragonstone Isle , <entity class="NE" id=7689>Stannis Baratheon</entity> learns of <entity class="NE" id=7690>Joffrey</entity> 's death and warns <entity class="NE" id=7691>Ser Davos</entity> that their time to lay claim to the <entity class="NE" id=7692>Iron</entity> throne dwindles if no army can be secured to wage war again . Shortly after , when <entity class="NE" id=7693>Ser Davos</entity> begins his reading lessons with princess <entity class="NE" id=7694>Shireen Baratheon</entity> , he realizes a possible ally across the <entity class="NE" id=7695>Narrow Sea</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=7696>Iron Bank</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=7697>Braavos</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=7698>Wall</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=7699>North</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=7700>Castle Black</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7701>Samwell Tarly</entity> fears for the safety of <entity class="NE" id=7702>Gilly</entity> and moves her to a vassal town that frequently services the <entity class="NE" id=7703>Nights Watch</entity> brothers in bodily vices . <entity class="NE" id=7704>Sam</entity> is resolute in keeping <entity class="NE" id=7705>Gilly</entity> safe from all harm however and pledges to visit <entity class="NE" id=7705>Gilly</entity> as much as possible , instructing the inn at which he leaves her , that she will not be touched . Meanwhile , a village south of the wall is attacked by raiding wildlings under <entity class="NE" id=7706>Tormund</entity> and the cannibalistic Thenns . While the village is massacred , a lone boy is sent by the <entity class="NE" id=7707>Styr</entity> as a messenger to <entity class="NE" id=7708>Castle Black</entity> to relay an account of the massacre and also a warning that more would follow . The <entity class="NE" id=7709>Lord Commander</entity> states that they do not have the manpower to afford venturing away from the <entity class="NE" id=7710>Wall</entity> . They are interrupted when two rangers , <entity class="NE" id=7711>Edd</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7712>Grenn</entity> , arrive back at <entity class="NE" id=7713>Castle Black</entity> after escaping <entity class="NE" id=7714>Craster</entity> 's Keep . <entity class="NE" id=7715>Jon</entity> reveals he told <entity class="NE" id=7716>Mance Rayder</entity> that a thousand men armed <entity class="NE" id=7717>Castle Black</entity> and therefore points out that when <entity class="NE" id=7718>Mance</entity> reaches <entity class="NE" id=7719>Craster</entity> 's Keep , <entity class="NE" id=7720>Rast</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7721>Karl</entity> will not hesitate in revealing the truth . <entity class="NE" id=7722>Jon</entity> then insists the <entity class="NE" id=7723>Night</entity> 's Watch send a party to <entity class="NE" id=7724>Craster</entity> 's Keep to kill their traitor brothers before <entity class="NE" id=7725>Mance</entity> gets to them first . ​Across the <entity class="NE" id=7726>Narrow Sea</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=7727>Slaver</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=7728>Bay</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7729>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> marches on the city of <entity class="NE" id=7730>Meereen</entity> as she begins her siege of the slave city . She is faced with a champion 's duel where a riding knight of <entity class="NE" id=7731>Meereen</entity> challenges her to choose a champion that will fight for her . <entity class="NE" id=7732>Grey Worm</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7733>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7734>Barristan</entity> all volunteer to stand as her champion ; she refuses all three as too valuable to her . <entity class="NE" id=7735>Daario Daario</entity> , commander of the <entity class="NE" id=7736>Second Sons</entity> , then volunteers to be <entity class="NE" id=7737>Dany</entity> 's champion , and she accepts . As <entity class="NE" id=7738>Naharis</entity> quickly dispatches the <entity class="NE" id=7739>Meereen</entity> champion , <entity class="NE" id=7740>Dany</entity> begins her siege of the city by speaking of freedom to the gathered slaves and then catapulting the broken chains of those she has freed across the city walls , demonstrating her previous successes . As the slaves examine the broken chains , the <entity class="NE" id=7741>Great Masters</entity> look on , perhaps in fear .
