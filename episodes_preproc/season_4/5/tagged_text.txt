<entity class="NE" id=7890>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7891>Tywin</entity> plot the Crown’s next move . <entity class="NE" id=7892>Dany</entity> discusses future plans . <entity class="NE" id=7893>Jon</entity> embarks on a new mission . Across the <entity class="NE" id=7894>Narrow Sea</entity> . In her new headquarters atop the <entity class="NE" id=7895>Great Pyramid</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7896>Daenerys</entity> learns that <entity class="NE" id=7897>Joffrey</entity> is dead and <entity class="NE" id=7898>Tommen</entity> has been crwoned . She is irritated to learn that <entity class="NE" id=7899>Daario Naharis</entity> has captured <entity class="NE" id=7900>Meereen</entity> 's navy without her explicit orders to do so , but mulls over the possibility of setting sail for <entity class="NE" id=7901>Westeros</entity> and taking <entity class="NE" id=7902>King</entity> 's Landing with her 8,000 Unsullied and 2,000 Second Sons . <entity class="NE" id=7903>Barristan Barristan</entity> is optimistic about their chances , believing that old Westerosi families will flock to their cause once <entity class="NE" id=7904>Daenerys</entity> crosses the <entity class="NE" id=7905>Narrow Sea</entity> , swelling their numbers . <entity class="NE" id=7906>Jorah Jorah</entity> is less enthusiastic : while 10,000 troops should be enough to take <entity class="NE" id=7907>King</entity> 's Landing from its exhausted defenders , there 's still the rest of the continent to worry about . Her advisors then reveal more troubling news : the <entity class="NE" id=7908>Wise Masters</entity> have bounced back and re-enslaved every freed man in <entity class="NE" id=7909>Yunkai</entity> , and although <entity class="NE" id=7910>Astapor</entity> remains free , the council <entity class="NE" id=7911>Daenerys</entity> installed has been deposed by a butcher named <entity class="NE" id=7912>Cleon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7913>Daenerys</entity> dismisses everyone but <entity class="NE" id=7914>Jorah</entity> and muses that her plans are in shambles . He reminds her that she is the last Targaryen and the Mother of <entity class="NE" id=7915>Dragons</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=7916>Dany</entity> says she needs to be more than that . She laments that if she can not keep order in three cities , she has no hope of controlling seven kingdoms . She is therefore resolved to remain in <entity class="NE" id=7917>Meereen</entity> and `` do what queens do '' : rule . At <entity class="NE" id=7918>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=7919>Tommen</entity> is crowned king of the <entity class="NE" id=7920>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , while <entity class="NE" id=7921>Cersei</entity> makes what appears to be a peaceful gesture towards <entity class="NE" id=7922>Margaery</entity> , who remains wary . <entity class="NE" id=7923>Cersei</entity> talks to <entity class="NE" id=7924>Prince Oberyn</entity> and asks him a favor . She has n't seen her daughter , <entity class="NE" id=7925>Myrcella</entity> , in over a year . <entity class="NE" id=7926>Cersei</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=7927>Oberyn</entity> to take her a gift , a ship , since she missed her last nameday . ​Tywin reveals to Cersei their problem with the <entity class="NE" id=7928>Iron Bank</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=7929>Braavos</entity> ; they owe 'a tremendous sum , ' and the gold mines of the <entity class="NE" id=7930>Westerlands</entity> actually ran dry three years ago . Therefore , even though <entity class="NE" id=7931>Tywin</entity> admits the <entity class="NE" id=7932>Lannisters</entity> can trust nobody except themselves , they need the <entity class="NE" id=7933>Tyrells</entity> ' wealth and resources on their side . <entity class="NE" id=7934>Cersei</entity> suggests coming to some arrangement with one of their representatives , but <entity class="NE" id=7935>Tywin</entity> dismisses the idea , since the <entity class="NE" id=7936>Bank</entity> is a monolithic structure that can not be avoided , lied to or swayed . In the <entity class="NE" id=7937>Riverlands</entity> . While on the road , <entity class="NE" id=7938>Podrick</entity> proves to be a hindrance to <entity class="NE" id=7939>Brienne</entity> . He has problems with his horse and accidentally sets fire to a rabbit they were cooking . <entity class="NE" id=7940>Brienne</entity> tries to get rid of <entity class="NE" id=7941>Podrick</entity> by releasing him from the vow he swore as her squire , but to no avail . They are bound for <entity class="NE" id=7942>Castle Black</entity> , where <entity class="NE" id=7943>Brienne</entity> believes <entity class="NE" id=7944>Sansa</entity> may have taken refuge with her half-brother , <entity class="NE" id=7945>Jon Snow</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7946>Brienne</entity> questions <entity class="NE" id=7947>Podrick</entity> about his duties as squire to <entity class="NE" id=7948>Tyrion</entity> . He tells her his job was mostly pouring wine , alongside other menial tasks . <entity class="NE" id=7949>Brienne</entity> then asks if <entity class="NE" id=7950>Podrick</entity> did anything related to combat . <entity class="NE" id=7951>Podrick</entity> reveals how he killed <entity class="NE" id=7952>Ser Mandon Moore</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=7953>Kingsguard</entity> by shoving a spear through his head when he tried to kill <entity class="NE" id=7954>Tyrion</entity> during the <entity class="NE" id=7955>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=7956>Blackwater</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7957>Brienne</entity> then grants Podrick a bit of respect and allows him to help her remove her armor . In the <entity class="NE" id=7958>Vale</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=7959>Arryn</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7960>Lord Lord</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7961>Sansa Stark</entity> arrive safely at the <entity class="NE" id=7962>Bloody Gate</entity> , though <entity class="NE" id=7963>Petyr</entity> has <entity class="NE" id=7964>Sansa</entity> cover her hair , as auburn is widely known as a Tully trait , and introduces her as his niece , <entity class="NE" id=7965>Alayne</entity> . Upon arriving at the Eyrie itself , <entity class="NE" id=7966>Sansa</entity> tries to slip into her alias , but <entity class="NE" id=7967>Lysa Arryn</entity> tells her not to bother around her own flesh and blood . <entity class="NE" id=7968>Lysa</entity> laments <entity class="NE" id=7969>Sansa</entity> 's treatment in <entity class="NE" id=7970>King</entity> 's Landing , ignoring her attempts to defend <entity class="NE" id=7971>Tyrion</entity> 's character . <entity class="NE" id=7972>Robin Robin</entity> is delighted to see <entity class="NE" id=7973>Petyr</entity> and to show <entity class="NE" id=7974>Sansa</entity> the <entity class="NE" id=7975>Moon Door</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7976>Lysa</entity> , apparently having finally given <entity class="NE" id=7977>Robin</entity> some independence , reminds him never to reveal <entity class="NE" id=7978>Sansa</entity> 's identity and tells him to show her to her chambers . The instant they leave , <entity class="NE" id=7979>Lysa</entity> , for unclear reasons , insists on marrying <entity class="NE" id=7980>Petyr</entity> immediately , claiming that they already had a wedding night many years ago . She references poisoning her former husband 's wine and framing the Lannisters by writing to her sister <entity class="NE" id=7981>Catelyn</entity> , using these actions as proof of her love for <entity class="NE" id=7982>Petyr</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7983>Petyr</entity> is unable to deter her , particularly when <entity class="NE" id=7984>Lysa</entity> reveals that a <entity class="NE" id=7985>Septon</entity> and witnesses have been waiting outside the main door . A delighted Lysa declares that she will scream so loudly that night that they will be able to hear her across the <entity class="NE" id=7986>Narrow Sea</entity> . Later that night , an exasperated Sansa attempts to sleep as <entity class="NE" id=7987>Lysa</entity> tries to fulfil that promise . Later on , <entity class="NE" id=7988>Lysa</entity> has a meal with <entity class="NE" id=7989>Sansa</entity> , giving her some lemon cakes . <entity class="NE" id=7990>Sansa</entity> , relieved to be safe at last , indulges herself , though she becomes a little self-conscious when <entity class="NE" id=7991>Lysa</entity> begins telling stories of <entity class="NE" id=7992>Catelyn</entity> 's overeating in her youth . <entity class="NE" id=7993>Lysa</entity> encourages <entity class="NE" id=7994>Sansa</entity> to keep eating , as she was only telling a story , and anyway , <entity class="NE" id=7995>Petyr</entity> had three crates of lemons brought from the <entity class="NE" id=7996>Crownlands</entity> just for <entity class="NE" id=7994>Sansa</entity> 's cakes . <entity class="NE" id=7997>Lysa</entity> suddenly degenerates from a kindly aunt into a psychotic newlywed half-mad with jealousy and demands to know why <entity class="NE" id=7998>Petyr</entity> cares so much about <entity class="NE" id=7999>Sansa</entity> , and if he has slept with her as he has his whores . She also rants about <entity class="NE" id=8000>Catelyn</entity> 's love for <entity class="NE" id=8001>Sansa</entity> 's uncle <entity class="NE" id=8002>Brandon</entity> and how he nearly killed <entity class="NE" id=8003>Petyr</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8004>Horrified</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8005>Sansa</entity> weeps and insists that she is still a virgin and that <entity class="NE" id=8006>Petyr</entity> thinks she 's just a stupid girl who does n't know anything , and who can not lie at all so always tells the truth . <entity class="NE" id=8007>Lysa</entity> immediately calms down and comforts <entity class="NE" id=8008>Sansa</entity> , assuring her that she believes her , and that since neither Tyrion nor <entity class="NE" id=8009>Petyr</entity> had slept with her , <entity class="NE" id=8008>Sansa</entity> can proceed to marry <entity class="NE" id=8010>Robin</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8011>Sansa</entity> seems unsure of what to make of this information , but one thing is clear : King 's Landing has made her a consummate actress . On the road to the <entity class="NE" id=8012>Eyrie</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8013>Sandor Clegane</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8014>Arya Stark</entity> continue to spar verbally and physically , particularly when <entity class="NE" id=8015>Clegane</entity> disparages <entity class="NE" id=8016>Arya</entity> 's water dancing and insults <entity class="NE" id=8017>Syrio Forel</entity> for being overcome by a glorified thug like <entity class="NE" id=8018>Meryn Trant</entity> . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=8019>Wall</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=8020>Craster</entity> 's Keep , <entity class="NE" id=8021>Locke</entity> scouts the keep for the party of the <entity class="NE" id=8022>Night's Watch</entity> sent to eliminate the traitors holed up there ; in his reconnaissance , <entity class="NE" id=8021>Locke</entity> finds the hut where <entity class="NE" id=8023>Bran Stark</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8024>Jojen</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8025>Meera</entity> and Hodor are being held captive . Reporting back to <entity class="NE" id=8026>Jon Snow</entity> and the others , <entity class="NE" id=8027>Locke</entity> tells them that only 11 traitors are present and most of them are drunk and wo n't prove much of a threat . He also lies about the hut where the prisoners are being kept , claiming there are hounds kept inside and that they should keep away from it to prevent the dogs alerting their enemy . <entity class="NE" id=8028>Jon</entity> agrees and tells the party they attack at nightfall . That night , <entity class="NE" id=8029>Karl</entity> enters the prisoners ' hut and attempts to rape <entity class="NE" id=8030>Meera</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=8031>Jojen</entity> distracts <entity class="NE" id=8029>Karl</entity> when he reveals his possession of greensight and claims to have seen <entity class="NE" id=8029>Karl</entity> dead before the night is out . At that moment , <entity class="NE" id=8032>Rast</entity> rushes in to warn Karl the keep is under attack ; <entity class="NE" id=8033>Jon</entity> 's party rushes through the defenses and starts killing their traitorous former brethren . In the confusion , <entity class="NE" id=8034>Locke</entity> slips into the tent and attempts to abduct <entity class="NE" id=8035>Bran</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=8035>Bran</entity> wargs into <entity class="NE" id=8036>Hodor</entity> and uses him to kill <entity class="NE" id=8034>Locke</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8037>Bran</entity> spots <entity class="NE" id=8038>Jon</entity> in the fighting , but <entity class="NE" id=8039>Jojen</entity> prevents him from going to his older brother , reminding <entity class="NE" id=8037>Bran</entity> that they must continue onward to reach the three-eyed raven and that <entity class="NE" id=8038>Jon</entity> would stop them . <entity class="NE" id=8040>Bran</entity> reluctantly leaves despite being so close to Jon.​ . The <entity class="NE" id=8041>Night's Watch</entity> swiftly overcome their enemy and <entity class="NE" id=8042>Jon</entity> confronts Karl in single combat . <entity class="NE" id=8043>Karl</entity> 's use of dirty tactics learned in his criminal past give him the upper hand . Before he can finish <entity class="NE" id=8044>Jon</entity> , one of <entity class="NE" id=8045>Craster</entity> 's wives , <entity class="NE" id=8046>Sissy</entity> , stabs him from behind . When <entity class="NE" id=8047>Karl</entity> rounds on her , <entity class="NE" id=8048>Jon</entity> gets back to his feet and drives Longclaw through the back of <entity class="NE" id=8047>Karl</entity> 's skull , killing him . In the aftermath of the battle , four brothers of the <entity class="NE" id=8049>Night's Watch</entity> , including <entity class="NE" id=8050>Locke</entity> , are found to have died , while all the traitors but one are accounted for . The sole survivor , <entity class="NE" id=8051>Rast</entity> , runs in terror through the forest until he reaches the cage where <entity class="NE" id=8052>Ghost</entity> was held . He notices someone has opened the cage but before he can do more than absorb this fact , the direwolf lunges out of nowhere and kills him . <entity class="NE" id=8053>Ghost</entity> then finds his way back to <entity class="NE" id=8054>Jon</entity> , who is overjoyed to see his companion again . Speaking to <entity class="NE" id=8055>Craster</entity> 's wives , <entity class="NE" id=8056>Jon</entity> warns them that <entity class="NE" id=8057>Mance Rayder</entity> 's army and worse besides will soon reach their location and offers to take them to safety south of the <entity class="NE" id=8058>Wall</entity> , but the women refuse , preferring to set out on their own . Before departing back for <entity class="NE" id=8059>Castle Black</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8060>Jon</entity> has <entity class="NE" id=8061>Craster</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=8062>Keep</entity> burned to the ground , along with the bodies of all those who died there .
