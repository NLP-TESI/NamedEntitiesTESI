<entity id=7921>Cersei</entity> and <entity id=7922>Tywin</entity> plot the Crown’s next move . <entity id=7923>Dany</entity> discusses future plans . <entity id=7924>Jon</entity> embarks on a new mission . Across the <entity id=7925>Narrow Sea</entity> . In her new headquarters atop the <entity id=7926>Great Pyramid</entity> , <entity id=7927>Daenerys</entity> learns that <entity id=7928>Joffrey</entity> is dead and <entity id=7929>Tommen</entity> has been crwoned . She is irritated to learn that <entity id=7930>Daario Naharis</entity> has captured <entity id=7931>Meereen</entity> 's navy without her explicit orders to do so , but mulls over the possibility of setting sail for <entity id=7932>Westeros</entity> and taking <entity id=7933>King</entity> 's Landing with her 8,000 Unsullied and 2,000 Second Sons . <entity id=7934>Barristan Barristan</entity> is optimistic about their chances , believing that old Westerosi families will flock to their cause once <entity id=7935>Daenerys</entity> crosses the <entity id=7936>Narrow Sea</entity> , swelling their numbers . <entity id=7937>Jorah Jorah</entity> is less enthusiastic : while 10,000 troops should be enough to take <entity id=7938>King</entity> 's Landing from its exhausted defenders , there 's still the rest of the continent to worry about . Her advisors then reveal more troubling news : the <entity id=7939>Wise Masters</entity> have bounced back and re-enslaved every freed man in <entity id=7940>Yunkai</entity> , and although <entity id=7941>Astapor</entity> remains free , the council <entity id=7942>Daenerys</entity> installed has been deposed by a butcher named <entity id=7943>Cleon</entity> . <entity id=7944>Daenerys</entity> dismisses everyone but <entity id=7945>Jorah</entity> and muses that her plans are in shambles . He reminds her that she is the last Targaryen and the Mother of <entity id=7946>Dragons</entity> , but <entity id=7947>Dany</entity> says she needs to be more than that . She laments that if she can not keep order in three cities , she has no hope of controlling seven kingdoms . She is therefore resolved to remain in <entity id=7948>Meereen</entity> and `` do what queens do '' : rule . At <entity id=7949>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity id=7950>Tommen</entity> is crowned king of the <entity id=7951>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , while <entity id=7952>Cersei</entity> makes what appears to be a peaceful gesture towards <entity id=7953>Margaery</entity> , who remains wary . <entity id=7954>Cersei</entity> talks to <entity id=7955>Prince Oberyn</entity> and asks him a favor . She has n't seen her daughter , <entity id=7956>Myrcella</entity> , in over a year . <entity id=7957>Cersei</entity> asks <entity id=7958>Oberyn</entity> to take her a gift , a ship , since she missed her last nameday . ​Tywin reveals to Cersei their problem with the <entity id=7959>Iron Bank</entity> of <entity id=7960>Braavos</entity> ; they owe 'a tremendous sum , ' and the gold mines of the <entity id=7961>Westerlands</entity> actually ran dry three years ago . Therefore , even though <entity id=7962>Tywin</entity> admits the <entity id=7963>Lannisters</entity> can trust nobody except themselves , they need the <entity id=7964>Tyrells</entity> ' wealth and resources on their side . <entity id=7965>Cersei</entity> suggests coming to some arrangement with one of their representatives , but <entity id=7966>Tywin</entity> dismisses the idea , since the <entity id=7967>Bank</entity> is a monolithic structure that can not be avoided , lied to or swayed . In the <entity id=7968>Riverlands</entity> . While on the road , <entity id=7969>Podrick</entity> proves to be a hindrance to <entity id=7970>Brienne</entity> . He has problems with his horse and accidentally sets fire to a rabbit they were cooking . <entity id=7971>Brienne</entity> tries to get rid of <entity id=7972>Podrick</entity> by releasing him from the vow he swore as her squire , but to no avail . They are bound for <entity id=7973>Castle Black</entity> , where <entity id=7974>Brienne</entity> believes <entity id=7975>Sansa</entity> may have taken refuge with her half-brother , <entity id=7976>Jon Snow</entity> . <entity id=7977>Brienne</entity> questions <entity id=7978>Podrick</entity> about his duties as squire to <entity id=7979>Tyrion</entity> . He tells her his job was mostly pouring wine , alongside other menial tasks . <entity id=7980>Brienne</entity> then asks if <entity id=7981>Podrick</entity> did anything related to combat . <entity id=7982>Podrick</entity> reveals how he killed <entity id=7983>Ser Mandon Moore</entity> of the <entity id=7984>Kingsguard</entity> by shoving a spear through his head when he tried to kill <entity id=7985>Tyrion</entity> during the <entity id=7986>Battle</entity> of the <entity id=7987>Blackwater</entity> . <entity id=7988>Brienne</entity> then grants Podrick a bit of respect and allows him to help her remove her armor . In the <entity id=7989>Vale</entity> of <entity id=7990>Arryn</entity> . <entity id=7991>Lord Lord</entity> and <entity id=7992>Sansa Stark</entity> arrive safely at the <entity id=7993>Bloody Gate</entity> , though <entity id=7994>Petyr</entity> has <entity id=7995>Sansa</entity> cover her hair , as auburn is widely known as a Tully trait , and introduces her as his niece , <entity id=7996>Alayne</entity> . Upon arriving at the Eyrie itself , <entity id=7997>Sansa</entity> tries to slip into her alias , but <entity id=7998>Lysa Arryn</entity> tells her not to bother around her own flesh and blood . <entity id=7999>Lysa</entity> laments <entity id=8000>Sansa</entity> 's treatment in <entity id=8001>King</entity> 's Landing , ignoring her attempts to defend <entity id=8002>Tyrion</entity> 's character . <entity id=8003>Robin Robin</entity> is delighted to see <entity id=8004>Petyr</entity> and to show <entity id=8005>Sansa</entity> the <entity id=8006>Moon Door</entity> . <entity id=8007>Lysa</entity> , apparently having finally given <entity id=8008>Robin</entity> some independence , reminds him never to reveal <entity id=8009>Sansa</entity> 's identity and tells him to show her to her chambers . The instant they leave , <entity id=8010>Lysa</entity> , for unclear reasons , insists on marrying <entity id=8011>Petyr</entity> immediately , claiming that they already had a wedding night many years ago . She references poisoning her former husband 's wine and framing the Lannisters by writing to her sister <entity id=8012>Catelyn</entity> , using these actions as proof of her love for <entity id=8013>Petyr</entity> . <entity id=8014>Petyr</entity> is unable to deter her , particularly when <entity id=8015>Lysa</entity> reveals that a <entity id=8016>Septon</entity> and witnesses have been waiting outside the main door . A delighted Lysa declares that she will scream so loudly that night that they will be able to hear her across the <entity id=8017>Narrow Sea</entity> . Later that night , an exasperated Sansa attempts to sleep as <entity id=8018>Lysa</entity> tries to fulfil that promise . Later on , <entity id=8019>Lysa</entity> has a meal with <entity id=8020>Sansa</entity> , giving her some lemon cakes . <entity id=8021>Sansa</entity> , relieved to be safe at last , indulges herself , though she becomes a little self-conscious when <entity id=8022>Lysa</entity> begins telling stories of <entity id=8023>Catelyn</entity> 's overeating in her youth . <entity id=8024>Lysa</entity> encourages <entity id=8025>Sansa</entity> to keep eating , as she was only telling a story , and anyway , <entity id=8026>Petyr</entity> had three crates of lemons brought from the <entity id=8027>Crownlands</entity> just for <entity id=8025>Sansa</entity> 's cakes . <entity id=8028>Lysa</entity> suddenly degenerates from a kindly aunt into a psychotic newlywed half-mad with jealousy and demands to know why <entity id=8029>Petyr</entity> cares so much about <entity id=8030>Sansa</entity> , and if he has slept with her as he has his whores . She also rants about <entity id=8031>Catelyn</entity> 's love for <entity id=8032>Sansa</entity> 's uncle <entity id=8033>Brandon</entity> and how he nearly killed <entity id=8034>Petyr</entity> . <entity id=8035>Horrified</entity> , <entity id=8036>Sansa</entity> weeps and insists that she is still a virgin and that <entity id=8037>Petyr</entity> thinks she 's just a stupid girl who does n't know anything , and who can not lie at all so always tells the truth . <entity id=8038>Lysa</entity> immediately calms down and comforts <entity id=8039>Sansa</entity> , assuring her that she believes her , and that since neither Tyrion nor <entity id=8040>Petyr</entity> had slept with her , <entity id=8039>Sansa</entity> can proceed to marry <entity id=8041>Robin</entity> . <entity id=8042>Sansa</entity> seems unsure of what to make of this information , but one thing is clear : King 's Landing has made her a consummate actress . On the road to the <entity id=8043>Eyrie</entity> , <entity id=8044>Sandor Clegane</entity> and <entity id=8045>Arya Stark</entity> continue to spar verbally and physically , particularly when <entity id=8046>Clegane</entity> disparages <entity id=8047>Arya</entity> 's water dancing and insults <entity id=8048>Syrio Forel</entity> for being overcome by a glorified thug like <entity id=8049>Meryn Trant</entity> . Beyond the <entity id=8050>Wall</entity> . At <entity id=8051>Craster</entity> 's Keep , <entity id=8052>Locke</entity> scouts the keep for the party of the <entity id=8053>Night's Watch</entity> sent to eliminate the traitors holed up there ; in his reconnaissance , <entity id=8052>Locke</entity> finds the hut where <entity id=8054>Bran Stark</entity> , <entity id=8055>Jojen</entity> , <entity id=8056>Meera</entity> and Hodor are being held captive . Reporting back to <entity id=8057>Jon Snow</entity> and the others , <entity id=8058>Locke</entity> tells them that only 11 traitors are present and most of them are drunk and wo n't prove much of a threat . He also lies about the hut where the prisoners are being kept , claiming there are hounds kept inside and that they should keep away from it to prevent the dogs alerting their enemy . <entity id=8059>Jon</entity> agrees and tells the party they attack at nightfall . That night , <entity id=8060>Karl</entity> enters the prisoners ' hut and attempts to rape <entity id=8061>Meera</entity> , but <entity id=8062>Jojen</entity> distracts <entity id=8060>Karl</entity> when he reveals his possession of greensight and claims to have seen <entity id=8060>Karl</entity> dead before the night is out . At that moment , <entity id=8063>Rast</entity> rushes in to warn Karl the keep is under attack ; <entity id=8064>Jon</entity> 's party rushes through the defenses and starts killing their traitorous former brethren . In the confusion , <entity id=8065>Locke</entity> slips into the tent and attempts to abduct <entity id=8066>Bran</entity> , but <entity id=8066>Bran</entity> wargs into <entity id=8067>Hodor</entity> and uses him to kill <entity id=8065>Locke</entity> . <entity id=8068>Bran</entity> spots <entity id=8069>Jon</entity> in the fighting , but <entity id=8070>Jojen</entity> prevents him from going to his older brother , reminding <entity id=8068>Bran</entity> that they must continue onward to reach the three-eyed raven and that <entity id=8069>Jon</entity> would stop them . <entity id=8071>Bran</entity> reluctantly leaves despite being so close to Jon.​ . The <entity id=8072>Night's Watch</entity> swiftly overcome their enemy and <entity id=8073>Jon</entity> confronts Karl in single combat . <entity id=8074>Karl</entity> 's use of dirty tactics learned in his criminal past give him the upper hand . Before he can finish <entity id=8075>Jon</entity> , one of <entity id=8076>Craster</entity> 's wives , <entity id=8077>Sissy</entity> , stabs him from behind . When <entity id=8078>Karl</entity> rounds on her , <entity id=8079>Jon</entity> gets back to his feet and drives Longclaw through the back of <entity id=8078>Karl</entity> 's skull , killing him . In the aftermath of the battle , four brothers of the <entity id=8080>Night's Watch</entity> , including <entity id=8081>Locke</entity> , are found to have died , while all the traitors but one are accounted for . The sole survivor , <entity id=8082>Rast</entity> , runs in terror through the forest until he reaches the cage where <entity id=8083>Ghost</entity> was held . He notices someone has opened the cage but before he can do more than absorb this fact , the direwolf lunges out of nowhere and kills him . <entity id=8084>Ghost</entity> then finds his way back to <entity id=8085>Jon</entity> , who is overjoyed to see his companion again . Speaking to <entity id=8086>Craster</entity> 's wives , <entity id=8087>Jon</entity> warns them that <entity id=8088>Mance Rayder</entity> 's army and worse besides will soon reach their location and offers to take them to safety south of the <entity id=8089>Wall</entity> , but the women refuse , preferring to set out on their own . Before departing back for <entity id=8090>Castle Black</entity> , <entity id=8091>Jon</entity> has <entity id=8092>Craster</entity> 's <entity id=8093>Keep</entity> burned to the ground , along with the bodies of all those who died there .
