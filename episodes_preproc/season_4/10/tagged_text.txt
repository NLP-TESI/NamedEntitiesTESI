Circumstances change after an unexpected arrival from north of the <entity id=8849>Wall</entity> . <entity id=8850>Dany</entity> must face harsh realities . <entity id=8851>Bran</entity> learns more about his destiny . <entity id=8852>Tyrion</entity> sees the truth about his situation . At the <entity id=8853>Wall</entity> , and Beyond . <entity id=8854>Jon Jon</entity> emerges from the outer gate of the <entity id=8855>Wall</entity> and begins trudging north through the aftermath of the previous night 's battle towards <entity id=8856>Mance Rayder's</entity> war camp . <entity id=8857>Jon</entity> eventually reaches the tree line and is quickly surrounded by wildlings , who bring him before <entity id=8858>Mance</entity> , who notes that he is wearing the black of the <entity id=8859>Night's Watch</entity> again . <entity id=8860>Mance</entity> brings <entity id=8861>Jon</entity> inside his tent , and questions his status as a traitor . <entity id=8862>Jon</entity> confesses that his time spent with the wildlings was all part of a plan orchestrated by <entity id=8863>Qhorin Halfhand</entity> to get <entity id=8862>Jon</entity> to infiltrate <entity id=8864>Mance</entity> 's army , and that <entity id=8865>Qhorin</entity> tricked Mance into trusting <entity id=8862>Jon</entity> by allowing <entity id=8862>Jon</entity> to kill <entity id=8865>Qhorin</entity> himself in a fight . <entity id=8866>Mance</entity> asks about <entity id=8867>Ygritte</entity> and <entity id=8868>Jon</entity> reveals that she died at the <entity id=8869>Battle</entity> of <entity id=8870>Castle Black</entity> , though not by his hands . Saddened , <entity id=8871>Mance</entity> proposes that they drink a toast to her memory , but <entity id=8872>Jon</entity> is hesitant when given an unfamiliar drink . <entity id=8873>Jon</entity> accepts after <entity id=8874>Mance</entity> assures him that if he 'd wanted to kill <entity id=8873>Jon</entity> , poison would be the last of his methods . <entity id=8875>Mance</entity> then asks about the giant who got through the gate but never came out , and <entity id=8876>Jon</entity> informs Mance that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner gate at the hands of his friend <entity id=8877>Grenn</entity> . <entity id=8878>Mance</entity> ruefully notes that the giant was named Mag the <entity id=8879>Mighty</entity> , and he was `` king '' of the giants , the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the <entity id=8880>First Men</entity> entered <entity id=8881>Westeros</entity> , to which <entity id=8882>Jon</entity> then glibly notes that his friend <entity id=8883>Grenn</entity> was from a farm . They have another toast to <entity id=8884>Mag</entity> and <entity id=8885>Grenn</entity> . <entity id=8886>Jon</entity> then proposes his terms to <entity id=8887>Mance</entity> : Mance is to turn his army around and return home . <entity id=8888>Mance</entity> immediately counters that the <entity id=8889>Night's Watch</entity> is low on oil , arrows , and men , and when he sent his full force against the Wall the <entity id=8889>Night's Watch</entity> threw everything they had at him to repel the attack . <entity id=8890>Mance</entity> guesses there are no more than 50 men left guarding <entity id=8891>Castle Black</entity> , but <entity id=8892>Jon</entity> lies and insists that there are still over 1,000 men defending the garrison . However , <entity id=8893>Mance</entity> calls <entity id=8894>Jon</entity> 's bluff and reveals that after seeing how few men were defending <entity id=8895>Castle Black</entity> , he sent 400 men about five miles west to climb an unmanned section of the <entity id=8896>Wall</entity> , and they will attack <entity id=8895>Castle Black</entity> 's weak southern side as soon as he gives the order . <entity id=8897>Mance</entity> then changes his demeanor and reveals that his people have suffered enough bloodshed and that he has no intention of conquering the lands south of the <entity id=8898>Wall</entity> ; that the wildlings are moving south to seek refuge from the growing threat of the <entity id=8899>White</entity> Walkers just as those south of the Wall are . <entity id=8900>Mance</entity> then makes his counteroffer : if the <entity id=8901>Night's Watch</entity> will open the gates to the wildlings and allow them to pass through the <entity id=8902>Wall</entity> , no more harm will come to the black brothers . However , if his terms are refused , his wildling army will slaughter every last member of the <entity id=8903>Night's Watch</entity> and move south by force . <entity id=8904>Mance</entity> then notices that <entity id=8905>Jon</entity> is eyeing a cooking knife , and quickly deduces that <entity id=8905>Jon</entity> came to parley with <entity id=8904>Mance</entity> simply so he could assassinate him . He notes that at that moment his personal guards are far enough across the room that <entity id=8906>Jon</entity> might actually be able to kill him before being cut down himself , but that <entity id=8906>Jon</entity> must have known he would die assassinating <entity id=8907>Mance</entity> . <entity id=8908>Mance</entity> is shocked and questions <entity id=8909>Jon</entity> if this is what the <entity id=8910>Night's Watch</entity> has sunk to : killing a man who let him into his own tent , accepting a parley in good faith , who shared food and drink with him , and who even offered him ( relatively ) reasonable peace terms . <entity id=8911>Jon</entity> hesitates , but before anyone can make a move , war horns are heard from outside . <entity id=8912>Mance</entity> 's guards safely grab <entity id=8913>Jon</entity> during the distraction , and <entity id=8912>Mance</entity> demands to know if the <entity id=8914>Night's Watch</entity> is attacking them , but <entity id=8913>Jon</entity> admits that it 's just as <entity id=8912>Mance</entity> said : the <entity id=8914>Night's Watch</entity> does n't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the <entity id=8915>Wall</entity> and attack . <entity id=8916>Columns</entity> of heavy horse carrying hundreds of mounted cavalry charge into the wildling camp carrying the flaming stag banners of <entity id=8917>House Baratheon</entity> of <entity id=8918>Dragonstone</entity> , and are led by none other than <entity id=8919>Stannis Baratheon</entity> and <entity id=8920>Davos Seaworth</entity> . The wildlings are caught in their own camp , resting from the battle the night before and only expecting attacks from the <entity id=8921>Wall</entity> , so their eastern flank is completely undefended . As they are undisciplined and have no experience fighting heavily armored cavalry , they are quickly dispatched by Stannis' riders , who attack the wildling camp from both sides in two separate columns that catch the wildlings in a perfect double envelopment . Quickly cutting the wildling forces down , <entity id=8922>Stannis</entity> and <entity id=8923>Davos</entity> ride up to <entity id=8924>Mance</entity> , who throws down his weapons in surrender , officially ending the wildlings ' siege of <entity id=8925>Castle Black</entity> . <entity id=8926>Davos</entity> introduces <entity id=8927>Stannis</entity> as the true king of the <entity id=8928>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , but <entity id=8929>Mance</entity> wryly points out that they are not currently in the <entity id=8928>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity id=8930>Stannis</entity> demands that it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king . Resignedly , <entity id=8931>Mance</entity> says that the <entity id=8932>Free Folk</entity> do not kneel , knowing that <entity id=8933>Stannis</entity> will kill him if he does not . <entity id=8934>Davos</entity> , however , asks what a man of the <entity id=8935>Night's Watch</entity> is doing in the camp , and <entity id=8936>Jon</entity> explains that he came to treaty with the King-Beyond-the-Wall . <entity id=8937>Jon</entity> says that he knows that <entity id=8938>Stannis</entity> is the true king , as his own father died supporting his claim , revealing himself as the bastard son of <entity id=8939>Eddard Stark</entity> . This makes <entity id=8940>Stannis</entity> regard <entity id=8941>Jon</entity> more seriously . <entity id=8942>Stannis</entity> proclaims that <entity id=8943>Eddard</entity> was an honorable man , and asks <entity id=8944>Jon</entity> what <entity id=8945>Ned</entity> would have done with <entity id=8946>Mance</entity> . <entity id=8947>Jon</entity> responds that <entity id=8948>Mance</entity> could have killed him or tortured him when he was his captive but instead he spared his life , so instead of killing Mance he should be taken prisoner and interrogated . Before they leave the wildling camp , <entity id=8949>Jon</entity> also urges <entity id=8950>Stannis</entity> to burn the dead before nightfall . <entity id=8951>Melisandre</entity> looks through the flames , and sees Snow . Back at <entity id=8952>Castle Black</entity> , a funeral is held for the slain members of the <entity id=8953>Night's Watch</entity> , who have been arranged in a huge funeral pyre in the castle courtyard . <entity id=8954>Maester Maester</entity> delivers a eulogy , saying that they died to protect the men , women , and children of the south who will never even know who they were , that it is the duty of the surviving black brothers to keep alive their memory . <entity id=8955>Aemon</entity> closes his speech with the customary line , `` and now their watch has ended , '' which is repeated by the gathered men . <entity id=8956>Samwell</entity> then aids <entity id=8957>Aemon</entity> in setting the pyre alight , which is continued by <entity id=8958>Jon</entity> and other men carrying torches . <entity id=8959>Stannis</entity> and <entity id=8960>Davos</entity> look on , along with <entity id=8961>Queen Selyse</entity> and <entity id=8962>Princess Shireen</entity> . <entity id=8963>Jon</entity> looks across the flames and catches the gaze of <entity id=8964>Melisandre</entity> , who is standing on the opposite side of the pyre . <entity id=8965>Melisandre</entity> seems intrigued , her piercing stare clearly making <entity id=8966>Jon</entity> uneasy . Afterwards , <entity id=8967>Jon</entity> enters the chamber of the castle where <entity id=8968>Tormund</entity> is being held . <entity id=8969>Tormund</entity> asks why blind old <entity id=8970>Maester Aemon</entity> patched up his arrow wounds , and <entity id=8971>Jon</entity> says that <entity id=8972>Aemon</entity> is sworn to heal all wounded men , friend or foe . <entity id=8973>Tormund</entity> asks if <entity id=8974>Jon</entity> really loved <entity id=8975>Ygritte</entity> . <entity id=8976>Jon</entity> does n't respond . <entity id=8977>Tormund</entity> says that <entity id=8978>Ygritte</entity> truly loved him , and that he knew because although she never admitted it , she talked only of killing him , revealing her true feelings for him ( if she had n't loved him , she would n't have been so angered by his betrayal ) . Saddened , <entity id=8979>Tormund</entity> implores <entity id=8980>Jon</entity> that <entity id=8981>Ygritte</entity> 's final resting place should be in `` the real north . '' <entity id=8982>Jon</entity> then takes <entity id=8983>Ygritte</entity> 's corpse to the north side of the <entity id=8984>Wall</entity> and builds a funeral pyre for her near a sacred Heart tree . <entity id=8985>Jon</entity> looks at his lover one last time and lights her pyre , and weeps silently as he turns his back and heads home . <entity id=8986>Far</entity> to the north , <entity id=8987>Bran Stark</entity> and the <entity id=8988>Reed</entity> children continue their journey to find the Three-eyed raven , though they are on the brink of exhaustion . <entity id=8989>Jojen Jojen</entity> has grown sick and and he is barely able to stand , eventually collapsing into the snow . As <entity id=8990>Meera</entity> begs <entity id=8991>Jojen</entity> to gather what little strength he can muster to continue forward , <entity id=8992>Bran</entity> calls out to them , revealing that they have found the massive heart tree that <entity id=8992>Bran</entity> has seen in his visions . As they approach the tree , wights burst up from the snow , grabbing <entity id=8993>Jojen</entity> 's ankles and attempting to drag him under the ice . These wights appear far older than those seen near the <entity id=8994>Wall</entity> , appearing as ghastly skeletal warriors who move with surprising agility . <entity id=8995>Meera</entity> attempts to defend <entity id=8996>Jojen</entity> from the wights , but they begin to swarm over <entity id=8997>Hodor</entity> , who is too scared to fight back . <entity id=8998>Bran</entity> wargs into <entity id=8999>Hodor</entity> 's mind and begins fighting off the wights with the aid of his direwolf Summer , but more wights keep bursting through the ice and they are quickly overwhelmed . Just as all seems lost , the wights around <entity id=9000>Bran</entity> suddenly burst into fireballs , and he hears a young girl 's voice calling to him from a cave entrance at the base of the heart tree . Amidst the confusion <entity id=9001>Jojen</entity> is repeatedly stabbed by a wight before <entity id=9002>Meera</entity> can fight it off . The mysterious girl calls to <entity id=9003>Meera</entity> and says that <entity id=9004>Jojen</entity> is lost and that she must leave him if she wants to live . <entity id=9005>Meera</entity> hesitates , but <entity id=9006>Jojen</entity> urges her to save herself . <entity id=9007>Crying</entity> , <entity id=9008>Meera</entity> slits her brother 's throat to grant him the mercy of a quick death . <entity id=9009>Meera</entity> runs to the cave entrance along with <entity id=9010>Bran</entity> , <entity id=9011>Hodor</entity> , and Summer while the mysterious child covers their retreat by magically throwing fireballs from her hands at the wights . Just as the life drains from <entity id=9012>Jojen</entity> 's eyes , she launches a fireball at his body , immolating his corpse and preventing his return as a wight ( and fulfilling <entity id=9012>Jojen</entity> 's vision that his death would involve fire ) . They run into the cave , pursued by the wights , who instantly shatter upon crossing the threshold of the cave . The little girl explains that the power which animates the dead corpses is powerless inside the cave . When <entity id=9013>Bran</entity> asks who she is , she replies that `` the <entity id=9014>First Men</entity> called us 'the <entity id=9015>Children</entity> , but we were born long before them . '' <entity id=9016>Bran</entity> realizes that she is one of the last surviving members of the <entity id=9017>Children</entity> of the <entity id=9018>Forest</entity> , the original , non-human inhabitants of <entity id=9019>Westeros</entity> who carved the faces into weirwood trees and taught the <entity id=9020>First Men</entity> to worship the <entity id=9021>Old Gods</entity> thousands of years ago . The child leads them deeper into the cave , which is overgrown with white weirwood roots from the massive tree above . Other Children of the <entity id=9022>Forest</entity> peek out around corners as they advance . Finally , they arrive at a large central chamber , its floor littered with bones . In the middle of the cave is an old man seated in the middle of weirwood roots , which have grown around and even through much of his body . <entity id=9023>Hodor</entity> places <entity id=9024>Bran</entity> on the ground and <entity id=9024>Bran</entity> crawls towards the old man , asking if he is the Three-eyed raven who appeared in his visions . The old man admits that he is , having taken several forms in the past , but his true form is before them now . <entity id=9025>Meera</entity> is upset that her brother died to reach him , but the Three-eyed Raven says that <entity id=9026>Jojen</entity> ( who possessed the <entity id=9027>Greensight</entity> , as <entity id=9028>Bran</entity> does ) always knew that he would die helping <entity id=9028>Bran</entity> arrive here , but that he came nonetheless . He informs them that he has been watching all of them throughout their entire lives `` with a thousand eyes , and one . '' He continues by stating that <entity id=9029>Jojen</entity> died so that <entity id=9030>Bran</entity> could come here and regain what he has lost . <entity id=9031>Bran</entity> asks if he means he will regain the use of his legs . The Three-eyed raven replies that <entity id=9032>Bran</entity> will never walk again , `` but you will fly . `` . Across the <entity id=9033>Narrow Sea</entity> . In <entity id=9034>Meereen</entity> , <entity id=9035>Queen Daenerys Targaryen</entity> sits in her throne room where she is receiving the day 's supplicants . An old man named <entity id=9036>Fennesz</entity> approaches the throne , first speaking in <entity id=9037>High</entity> Valyrian but then revealing that he also knows the <entity id=9038>Common Tongue</entity> . <entity id=9039>Fennesz</entity> explains that he was not one of the slaves who toiled away at manual labor , but a well-educated teacher and servant to <entity id=9040>Master Mighdal</entity> , who employed him as a teacher for his own children . He tells Daenarys that <entity id=9041>Master Mighdal's</entity> seven year old daughter <entity id=9042>Calla</entity> admires <entity id=9043>Daenerys</entity> , having learned of the <entity id=9044>Targaryen</entity> dynasty through <entity id=9045>Fennesz</entity> 's teachings . As a servant of <entity id=9046>Master Mighdal</entity> , <entity id=9047>Fennesz</entity> was well-treated and even well-respected in the household , but when <entity id=9048>Daenerys</entity> forcibly freed all of the slaves in the city she did not understand the full-scale complications of suddenly having to care for so many people . <entity id=9049>Fennesz</entity> originally stayed in <entity id=9050>Master Mighdal</entity> 's house after she took the city , and <entity id=9051>Mighdal</entity> 's children begged him to stay , but <entity id=9051>Mighdal</entity> and <entity id=9049>Fennesz</entity> agreed that he must leave rather than face reprisals , forcing <entity id=9049>Fennesz</entity> to become homeless . <entity id=9052>Daenerys</entity> insists that she had established mess halls to feed the freed slaves and barracks to house them . <entity id=9053>Fennez</entity> says that he has visited these refugee centers and they are not very safe : the young prey on the old , assaulting and robbing them . <entity id=9054>Daenerys</entity> insists that her Unsullied will restore order , but <entity id=9055>Fennesz</entity> points out that even assuming that they are able to ensure his physical safety , he has lost his livelihood and his purpose and is too old to start anew . Therefore , he has come to <entity id=9056>Daenerys</entity> to beg her permission to sell himself back to <entity id=9057>Mighdal</entity> . She is shocked that he would want to be owned as a slave again , as a man might own a goat or a chair . He implores her that the young may rejoice in her new world , but for those too old to change , there is only fear and squalor . Nor , he says , is he alone : there are many supplicants waiting outside lining up to make similar requests . <entity id=9058>Daenerys</entity> is crestfallen , and says she did not liberate the slaves of <entity id=9059>Meereen</entity> only to preside over the very injustice she sought to destroy , but surprisingly relents and admits that freedom means making one 's own choices . Therefore she will allow <entity id=9060>Fennesz</entity> to enter into a labor contract with <entity id=9061>Mighdal</entity> , but lasting no more than one year . He earnestly thanks her , and leaves . <entity id=9062>Ser Ser</entity> warns <entity id=9063>Daenerys</entity> that the masters will assuredly take advantage of this , quickly making `` contracts '' with all of the displaced former slaves until they are all slaves again in all but name . The next supplicant then enters , a shepherd carrying a bundle in his arms , similarly to the herdsman who came to show the bones of their livestock which <entity id=9064>Daenerys</entity> 's dragons burned in order to be reimbursed . The shepherd timidly approaches and states that he is unable to speak in the common tongue and requires <entity id=9065>Missandei</entity> to translate . <entity id=9066>Distraught</entity> , he tells Daenarys that the `` winged shadow '' came , placing the bundle on the ground and opening it to reveal charred bones - of a human child . <entity id=9067>Daenerys</entity> 's largest dragon - the black one , <entity id=9068>Drogon</entity> - has roasted the man 's three year old daughter <entity id=9069>Zalla</entity> until this is all that was left of her . <entity id=9070>Horrified</entity> , <entity id=9071>Daenerys</entity> meets with <entity id=9072>Missandei</entity> and <entity id=9073>Grey Worm</entity> in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the dragons are posing to the people of <entity id=9074>Meereen</entity> . <entity id=9075>Grey Grey</entity> reports that <entity id=9076>Drogon</entity> was last seen flying over the <entity id=9077>Black Cliffs</entity> three days ago , but he can no longer be found . Realizing that she can no longer control her dragons , <entity id=9078>Daenerys</entity> tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the city . Later , she leads her remaining two dragons , <entity id=9079>Rhaegal</entity> and <entity id=9080>Viserion</entity> , into the catacombs , where they are distracted by sheep carcasses . As they are feeding , <entity id=9081>Daenerys</entity> personally locks huge iron collars around their necks , which are secured by heavy chains . She weeps as she does so , as it is symbolically reducing her remaining `` children '' to chained-up slaves themselves . <entity id=9082>Daenerys</entity> wordlessly leaves and closes the huge stone door to the catacombs behind her as her dragons grow distressed and pathetically call after her when they attempt to follow and realize they are chained in place . In the <entity id=9083>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . In <entity id=9084>Grand Maester M N</entity> 's laboratory in King's Landing , <entity id=9085>Cersei</entity> , <entity id=9086>Pycelle</entity> , and <entity id=9087>Qyburn</entity> stand over <entity id=9088>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> , who lies immobilized on a flat wooden table and is revealed to be suffering from a massive wound centered around his right side . <entity id=9089>Pycelle</entity> informs <entity id=9090>Cersei</entity> that <entity id=9091>Oberyn Martell</entity> had coated his spear with manticore venom , poisoning <entity id=9092>Ser Gregor</entity> . The effects are horrific , with <entity id=9093>Gregor</entity> 's wounds putrefying and creating a terrible stench . <entity id=9094>Pycelle</entity> says that he is beyond any hope of recovery , but <entity id=9095>Qyburn</entity> insists to Cersei that he can save him using more unorthodox methods . <entity id=9096>Pycelle</entity> chaffes at his suggestion , stating that he is not even a maester , and that such arrogance is what led to <entity id=9097>Qyburn</entity> 's expulsion from the <entity id=9098>Citadel</entity> in the first place , for experiments that were deemed both dangerous and `` unnatural . '' <entity id=9099>Cersei</entity> , determined to save <entity id=9100>Gregor</entity> from death , dismisses <entity id=9101>Pycelle</entity> and orders Qyburn to do whatever is necessary , infuriating <entity id=9101>Pycelle</entity> , who angrily shuffles out of the laboratory . She asks <entity id=9102>Qyburn</entity> if his treatment will work , and <entity id=9102>Qyburn</entity> claims that if his past work is any indicator , he stands a chance at saving <entity id=9103>Gregor</entity> . <entity id=9104>Qyburn</entity> states that the process will `` change '' him , although <entity id=9105>Cersei</entity> seems only concerned with whether it will weaken him , to which <entity id=9104>Qyburn</entity> replies `` Oh no . '' <entity id=9106>Cersei</entity> leaves , and <entity id=9107>Qyburn</entity> begins syphoning out <entity id=9108>Gregor</entity> 's tainted blood . <entity id=9109>Cersei</entity> approaches <entity id=9110>Tywin</entity> and insists that she will not submit to a forced marriage to <entity id=9111>Ser Loras Tyrell</entity> . He attempts to dismiss the subject by stating that the matter is closed , but she persists and says that it is not just because she does not love Loras : he wants to ship her off to <entity id=9112>Highgarden</entity> and remove her from the court entirely , keeping her away from her last remaining son . With <entity id=9113>Cersei</entity> out of the picture , both Margaery and <entity id=9114>Tywin</entity> will attempt to get their claws into <entity id=9115>Tommen</entity> , each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance . <entity id=9116>Tywin</entity> refuses to budge , so <entity id=9117>Cersei</entity> plays her trump card : she threatens to destroy <entity id=9118>House Lannister</entity> by telling everyone the truth . <entity id=9119>Tywin</entity> seems confused , and at first Cersei scoffs that he is merely feigning ignorance . With growing realization , she assesses that even the brilliant <entity id=9120>Tywin Lannister</entity> never noticed what was going on between his own children , when all it would have taken was one attentive moment in the past twenty years . <entity id=9121>Tywin</entity> is still apparently confused , so with a merciless grin <entity id=9122>Cersei</entity> reveals that all of the rumors about her and <entity id=9123>Jaime</entity> ( and their children ) are true – she will tell everyone and destroy <entity id=9121>Tywin</entity> 's vaunted family legacy , even though it will also mean her death and <entity id=9124>Tommen</entity> 's death . <entity id=9125>Tywin</entity> shakes with barely constrained rage , but in denial he accuses that <entity id=9126>Cersei</entity> is simply lying to anger him . <entity id=9127>Cersei</entity> says she doubts he truly thinks that and leaves him standing in his chamber alone . <entity id=9128>Cersei</entity> finds Jaime in the <entity id=9129>White Sword Tower</entity> , and he expresses disgust at her blatant attempts to have <entity id=9130>Tyrion</entity> killed . <entity id=9131>Cersei</entity> asserts that <entity id=9132>Tyrion</entity> killed their mother when she gave birth to him . <entity id=9133>Jaime</entity> is surprised that she still irrationally blames him for that , pointing out that he was an infant and had no control over what happened . He insists that <entity id=9134>Tyrion</entity> is her family , whether she chooses to accept it or not . She rebukes his claim , saying he is not her family and that they all have a choice , and that she chooses <entity id=9135>Jaime</entity> . She then reveals that she has spilled their secret to <entity id=9136>Tywin</entity> . He is stunned and concerned by her actions , asking how <entity id=9137>Tywin</entity> reacted to the news , but she states that she does not want to discuss their father . She begins to seduce him , saying she chooses her brother over everyone else in the world , no longer concerned with whether anyone else knows their secret . He yields to her advances , kissing her passionately and throwing her on the table where they begin to have sex . In the middle of the night , <entity id=9138>Tyrion</entity> is awoken in his cell by the sound of his cell door being opened by <entity id=9139>Jaime</entity> , who reveals that he has orchestrated an escape plan for Tyrion with the assistance of <entity id=9140>Varys</entity> , who has secured a galley in the harbor on which Tyrion can sneak out of the city and flee to the <entity id=9141>Free Cities</entity> . He leads <entity id=9142>Tyrion</entity> to a stairway leading up to a locked door , instructing <entity id=9142>Tyrion</entity> to knock on it twice and then twice more to summon <entity id=9143>Varys</entity> , who will lead him to the ship . Before they part ways , <entity id=9144>Tyrion</entity> and <entity id=9145>Jaime</entity> share a tender embrace and say their goodbyes , unsure if either will ever see the other again . <entity id=9146>Tyrion</entity> , alone , stares at the door at the top of the staircase , ultimately deciding to use the secret passages of the <entity id=9147>Red Keep</entity> to infiltrate the Tower of the <entity id=9148>Hand</entity> . He enters the <entity id=9149>Hand</entity> of the King 's quarters , and sees a woman lying in <entity id=9150>Tywin</entity> 's bed , with <entity id=9150>Tywin</entity> 's clothes folded up on a chair . As he draws closer he sees that the woman is <entity id=9151>Shae</entity> , who thinks it is <entity id=9152>Tywin</entity> and calls out for him , calling him `` my lion '' as she had once done to <entity id=9153>Tyrion</entity> . When she turns over and sees that it is <entity id=9154>Tyrion</entity> , looking utterly betrayed , she grabs a knife to defend herself . <entity id=9155>Tyrion</entity> could retreat but instead he rushes forward onto the bed to wrestle it from her grasp . <entity id=9156>Tyrion</entity> manages to knock the knife from her hands and the two continue to struggle violently until <entity id=9156>Tyrion</entity> manages to grab the necklace around her throat ( which he once gave her as a gift ) and strangles her with it . He continues to strangle her long after she has stopped resisting , until she is dead . He sinks to the floor and sits next to <entity id=9157>Shae</entity> 's lifeless body , weeping , and tells her he 's sorry . He stares at the wall across the room and sees several weapons on display , among them <entity id=9158>Joffrey</entity> 's old crossbow , and his expression quickly darkens . <entity id=9159>Tyrion</entity> takes the crossbow down from the wall , loads it , and heads down the hall to the privy , opening the door to find his father seated upon the toilet . <entity id=9160>Tywin</entity> seems surprised to see <entity id=9161>Tyrion</entity> , but quickly regains composure and asks <entity id=9161>Tyrion</entity> to lower the crossbow . He correctly deduces that <entity id=9162>Jaime</entity> helped <entity id=9163>Tyrion</entity> escape his cell , telling Tyrion that they can discuss the matter back in <entity id=9164>Tywin</entity> 's chambers . However , when he attempts to stand , <entity id=9165>Tyrion</entity> steadies the crossbow , stopping him dead in his tracks . `` All my life you 've wanted me dead , '' <entity id=9166>Tyrion</entity> states , and <entity id=9167>Tywin</entity> acknowledges the validity of his claim . He attempts to defuse the situation by telling Tyrion that despite this , <entity id=9168>Tyrion</entity> has stubbornly clung to life , which <entity id=9169>Tywin</entity> states he finds admirable and insists that he was never going to have <entity id=9168>Tyrion</entity> actually killed . <entity id=9170>Tyrion</entity> admits that he just murdered <entity id=9171>Shae</entity> with his bare hands , but <entity id=9172>Tywin</entity> scoffs that it does n't matter as she was nothing more than a whore . <entity id=9173>Tyrion</entity> is angered by <entity id=9174>Tywin</entity> 's indifference and raises the crossbow , threatening that if his father says the word `` whore '' one more time he will kill him . <entity id=9175>Tywin</entity> balks that <entity id=9176>Tyrion</entity> wo n't kill his own father in the privy , and again tries to convince Tyrion that they should continue to discuss this in his chambers . <entity id=9177>Tyrion</entity> says he can not go back to <entity id=9178>Tywin</entity> 's chambers because <entity id=9179>Shae</entity> 's body is still there . <entity id=9180>Tywin</entity> dares Tyrion by calling his bluff and mocking him by saying `` because you 're afraid of a dead whore ? `` . <entity id=9181>Tyrion</entity> was not bluffing . The moment <entity id=9182>Tywin</entity> utters the word `` whore '' again , <entity id=9183>Tyrion</entity> looses his crossbow bolt , hitting <entity id=9182>Tywin</entity> in the belly and knocking him backwards . <entity id=9184>Tywin</entity> is incredulous that <entity id=9185>Tyrion</entity> actually had the courage to fight back against him , and that he will die in such an undignified way at the hands of his hated dwarf son . As <entity id=9186>Tyrion</entity> reloads the crossbow , <entity id=9187>Tywin</entity> angrily declares that <entity id=9186>Tyrion</entity> is no son of his . `` I am your son , '' Tyrion replies quietly , `` I have always been your son , '' and fires a second bolt into <entity id=9188>Tywin</entity> 's heart , killing him . <entity id=9189>Tyrion</entity> discards the crossbow as he leaves to find <entity id=9190>Varys</entity> , who immediately realizes <entity id=9189>Tyrion</entity> has done something terrible , exclaiming `` What have you done ? '' Nonetheless , he leads <entity id=9191>Tyrion</entity> out of the castle to the docks where <entity id=9191>Tyrion</entity> is stowed away inconspicuously in a crate aboard the ship . <entity id=9192>Varys</entity> begins walking back towards the <entity id=9193>Red Keep</entity> but stops when he hears the bells begin to toll , signaling the discovery of <entity id=9194>Tywin</entity> 's body . Realizing that returning to the castle is likely unsafe , <entity id=9195>Varys</entity> turns around and heads back for the ship , sitting next to <entity id=9196>Tyrion</entity> 's crate in silence as they cast off for <entity id=9197>Essos</entity> . In the <entity id=9198>Vale</entity> , <entity id=9199>Brienne</entity> of <entity id=9200>Tarth</entity> and <entity id=9201>Podrick Payne</entity> are heading towards the <entity id=9202>Bloody Gate</entity> when they happen upon <entity id=9203>Arya Stark</entity> practicing her water dancing while <entity id=9204>Sandor Clegane</entity> is off relieving himself , both returning from the <entity id=9205>Eyrie</entity> after receiving words of <entity id=9206>Lysa Arryn</entity> 's death . <entity id=9207>Brienne</entity> and <entity id=9208>Arya</entity> converse for a moment , both showing respect for one another as they are both women who have fought against what has been expected of them their entire lives . They are interrupted by the return of the <entity id=9209>Hound</entity> , who is immediately recognized by <entity id=9210>Podrick</entity> , causing <entity id=9211>Brienne</entity> to realize that the girl is <entity id=9212>Arya</entity> . <entity id=9213>Brienne</entity> tells <entity id=9214>Arya</entity> of her sacred vow to protect her mother , although she failed to do so because she was sent by her mother to return <entity id=9215>Jaime Lannister</entity> . The <entity id=9216>Hound</entity> immediately accuses <entity id=9217>Brienne</entity> of working for the <entity id=9218>Lannisters</entity> , noticing her <entity id=9219>Valyrian</entity> steel sword <entity id=9220>Oathkeeper</entity> , which <entity id=9217>Brienne</entity> admits was given to her by <entity id=9221>Jaime</entity> , frightening <entity id=9222>Arya</entity> into thinking that <entity id=9217>Brienne</entity> is working for the <entity id=9218>Lannisters</entity> . <entity id=9223>Brienne</entity> implores <entity id=9224>Arya</entity> to come with her to safety , causing the <entity id=9225>Hound</entity> to mock <entity id=9223>Brienne</entity> , pointing out that there is no `` safety '' for <entity id=9224>Arya</entity> anymore : her aunt <entity id=9226>Lysa Arryn</entity> in the <entity id=9227>Eyrie –</entity> whom <entity id=9223>Brienne</entity> and <entity id=9228>Podrick</entity> are seeking out – is dead , as are her father , mother , and older brother , while the Stark armies are scattered and <entity id=9229>Winterfell</entity> is a smoking ruin . They draw swords and begin fighting , both eventually disarming each other and resorting to brutally fighting each other in <entity id=9230>hand-to-hand</entity> combat . Ultimately , <entity id=9231>Brienne</entity> gains the upper hand ( by biting off a chunk of <entity id=9232>Sandor</entity> 's ear ) and knocks him down a cliff side . <entity id=9233>Brienne</entity> goes to search for <entity id=9234>Arya</entity> , who slipped away during the melee and has hidden herself amongst the rock formations . As <entity id=9235>Brienne</entity> and <entity id=9236>Podrick</entity> search the surrounding area for Arya in vain , <entity id=9237>Arya</entity> makes her way down the cliff side to find the <entity id=9238>Hound</entity> badly wounded . He tells her that unless there is a maester miraculously on hand to tend to his wounds , he 's finished . <entity id=9239>Sandor</entity> tells her to kill him and scratch another name off her list , but she just sits and stares at him silently . He grows angry and begins recounting running down the butcher 's boy and how he should have raped <entity id=9240>Sansa</entity> in <entity id=9241>King</entity> 's Landing in an attempt to goad <entity id=9242>Arya</entity> into killing him in anger , but she remains silent . <entity id=9243>Sandor</entity> finally begs her to kill him and put him out of his misery , but she quietly refuses and takes his money purse , leaving him screaming at her to kill him as she silently walks away . <entity id=9244>Arya</entity> rides a horse to the nearby coast of the <entity id=9245>Vale</entity> , where she sees a wharf with ships docked . She approaches a captain and asks if she can pay for travel to the <entity id=9246>North</entity> , but he says that they wo n't go there because these days the <entity id=9246>North</entity> is full of war , cold , and pirates . Instead , the ship is going `` home '' : to the <entity id=9247>Free City</entity> of <entity id=9248>Braavos</entity> . <entity id=9249>Arya</entity> remembers the special coin that the <entity id=9250>Faceless Man</entity> known as <entity id=9251>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> gave her , and instructed her to present to any man from <entity id=9252>Braavos</entity> if she needed aid . She does so now , and the captain is utterly surprised at how she obtained it , but she says only `` Valar morghulis '' ( as <entity id=9253>Jaqen</entity> instructed ) , to which the captain gives the traditional response , `` Valar dohaeris . '' He warmly welcomes her aboard the ship , and insists that she will have her own cabin . As the ship casts off , <entity id=9254>Arya</entity> stands aboard the ship and watches as the shore of <entity id=9255>Westeros</entity> shrinks further and further away . She then moves to the prow of the ship , looking forward across the <entity id=9256>Narrow Sea</entity> in the direction of the <entity id=9257>Free Cities</entity> and <entity id=9258>Braavos</entity> .
