Circumstances change after an unexpected arrival from north of the <entity class="NE" id=8818>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8819>Dany</entity> must face harsh realities . <entity class="NE" id=8820>Bran</entity> learns more about his destiny . <entity class="NE" id=8821>Tyrion</entity> sees the truth about his situation . At the <entity class="NE" id=8822>Wall</entity> , and Beyond . <entity class="NE" id=8823>Jon Jon</entity> emerges from the outer gate of the <entity class="NE" id=8824>Wall</entity> and begins trudging north through the aftermath of the previous night 's battle towards <entity class="NE" id=8825>Mance Rayder's</entity> war camp . <entity class="NE" id=8826>Jon</entity> eventually reaches the tree line and is quickly surrounded by wildlings , who bring him before <entity class="NE" id=8827>Mance</entity> , who notes that he is wearing the black of the <entity class="NE" id=8828>Night's Watch</entity> again . <entity class="NE" id=8829>Mance</entity> brings <entity class="NE" id=8830>Jon</entity> inside his tent , and questions his status as a traitor . <entity class="NE" id=8831>Jon</entity> confesses that his time spent with the wildlings was all part of a plan orchestrated by <entity class="NE" id=8832>Qhorin Halfhand</entity> to get <entity class="NE" id=8831>Jon</entity> to infiltrate <entity class="NE" id=8833>Mance</entity> 's army , and that <entity class="NE" id=8834>Qhorin</entity> tricked Mance into trusting <entity class="NE" id=8831>Jon</entity> by allowing <entity class="NE" id=8831>Jon</entity> to kill <entity class="NE" id=8834>Qhorin</entity> himself in a fight . <entity class="NE" id=8835>Mance</entity> asks about <entity class="NE" id=8836>Ygritte</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8837>Jon</entity> reveals that she died at the <entity class="NE" id=8838>Battle</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=8839>Castle Black</entity> , though not by his hands . Saddened , <entity class="NE" id=8840>Mance</entity> proposes that they drink a toast to her memory , but <entity class="NE" id=8841>Jon</entity> is hesitant when given an unfamiliar drink . <entity class="NE" id=8842>Jon</entity> accepts after <entity class="NE" id=8843>Mance</entity> assures him that if he 'd wanted to kill <entity class="NE" id=8842>Jon</entity> , poison would be the last of his methods . <entity class="NE" id=8844>Mance</entity> then asks about the giant who got through the gate but never came out , and <entity class="NE" id=8845>Jon</entity> informs Mance that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner gate at the hands of his friend <entity class="NE" id=8846>Grenn</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8847>Mance</entity> ruefully notes that the giant was named Mag the <entity class="NE" id=8848>Mighty</entity> , and he was `` king '' of the giants , the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the <entity class="NE" id=8849>First Men</entity> entered <entity class="NE" id=8850>Westeros</entity> , to which <entity class="NE" id=8851>Jon</entity> then glibly notes that his friend <entity class="NE" id=8852>Grenn</entity> was from a farm . They have another toast to <entity class="NE" id=8853>Mag</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8854>Grenn</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8855>Jon</entity> then proposes his terms to <entity class="NE" id=8856>Mance</entity> : Mance is to turn his army around and return home . <entity class="NE" id=8857>Mance</entity> immediately counters that the <entity class="NE" id=8858>Night's Watch</entity> is low on oil , arrows , and men , and when he sent his full force against the Wall the <entity class="NE" id=8858>Night's Watch</entity> threw everything they had at him to repel the attack . <entity class="NE" id=8859>Mance</entity> guesses there are no more than 50 men left guarding <entity class="NE" id=8860>Castle Black</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=8861>Jon</entity> lies and insists that there are still over 1,000 men defending the garrison . However , <entity class="NE" id=8862>Mance</entity> calls <entity class="NE" id=8863>Jon</entity> 's bluff and reveals that after seeing how few men were defending <entity class="NE" id=8864>Castle Black</entity> , he sent 400 men about five miles west to climb an unmanned section of the <entity class="NE" id=8865>Wall</entity> , and they will attack <entity class="NE" id=8864>Castle Black</entity> 's weak southern side as soon as he gives the order . <entity class="NE" id=8866>Mance</entity> then changes his demeanor and reveals that his people have suffered enough bloodshed and that he has no intention of conquering the lands south of the <entity class="NE" id=8867>Wall</entity> ; that the wildlings are moving south to seek refuge from the growing threat of the <entity class="NE" id=8868>White</entity> Walkers just as those south of the Wall are . <entity class="NE" id=8869>Mance</entity> then makes his counteroffer : if the <entity class="NE" id=8870>Night's Watch</entity> will open the gates to the wildlings and allow them to pass through the <entity class="NE" id=8871>Wall</entity> , no more harm will come to the black brothers . However , if his terms are refused , his wildling army will slaughter every last member of the <entity class="NE" id=8872>Night's Watch</entity> and move south by force . <entity class="NE" id=8873>Mance</entity> then notices that <entity class="NE" id=8874>Jon</entity> is eyeing a cooking knife , and quickly deduces that <entity class="NE" id=8874>Jon</entity> came to parley with <entity class="NE" id=8873>Mance</entity> simply so he could assassinate him . He notes that at that moment his personal guards are far enough across the room that <entity class="NE" id=8875>Jon</entity> might actually be able to kill him before being cut down himself , but that <entity class="NE" id=8875>Jon</entity> must have known he would die assassinating <entity class="NE" id=8876>Mance</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8877>Mance</entity> is shocked and questions <entity class="NE" id=8878>Jon</entity> if this is what the <entity class="NE" id=8879>Night's Watch</entity> has sunk to : killing a man who let him into his own tent , accepting a parley in good faith , who shared food and drink with him , and who even offered him ( relatively ) reasonable peace terms . <entity class="NE" id=8880>Jon</entity> hesitates , but before anyone can make a move , war horns are heard from outside . <entity class="NE" id=8881>Mance</entity> 's guards safely grab <entity class="NE" id=8882>Jon</entity> during the distraction , and <entity class="NE" id=8881>Mance</entity> demands to know if the <entity class="NE" id=8883>Night's Watch</entity> is attacking them , but <entity class="NE" id=8882>Jon</entity> admits that it 's just as <entity class="NE" id=8881>Mance</entity> said : the <entity class="NE" id=8883>Night's Watch</entity> does n't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the <entity class="NE" id=8884>Wall</entity> and attack . <entity class="NE" id=8885>Columns</entity> of heavy horse carrying hundreds of mounted cavalry charge into the wildling camp carrying the flaming stag banners of <entity class="HSE" id=8886>House Baratheon</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=8887>Dragonstone</entity> , and are led by none other than <entity class="NE" id=8888>Stannis Baratheon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8889>Davos Seaworth</entity> . The wildlings are caught in their own camp , resting from the battle the night before and only expecting attacks from the <entity class="NE" id=8890>Wall</entity> , so their eastern flank is completely undefended . As they are undisciplined and have no experience fighting heavily armored cavalry , they are quickly dispatched by Stannis' riders , who attack the wildling camp from both sides in two separate columns that catch the wildlings in a perfect double envelopment . Quickly cutting the wildling forces down , <entity class="NE" id=8891>Stannis</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8892>Davos</entity> ride up to <entity class="NE" id=8893>Mance</entity> , who throws down his weapons in surrender , officially ending the wildlings ' siege of <entity class="NE" id=8894>Castle Black</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8895>Davos</entity> introduces <entity class="NE" id=8896>Stannis</entity> as the true king of the <entity class="NE" id=8897>Seven Kingdoms</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=8898>Mance</entity> wryly points out that they are not currently in the <entity class="NE" id=8897>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8899>Stannis</entity> demands that it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king . Resignedly , <entity class="NE" id=8900>Mance</entity> says that the <entity class="NE" id=8901>Free Folk</entity> do not kneel , knowing that <entity class="NE" id=8902>Stannis</entity> will kill him if he does not . <entity class="NE" id=8903>Davos</entity> , however , asks what a man of the <entity class="NE" id=8904>Night's Watch</entity> is doing in the camp , and <entity class="NE" id=8905>Jon</entity> explains that he came to treaty with the King-Beyond-the-Wall . <entity class="NE" id=8906>Jon</entity> says that he knows that <entity class="NE" id=8907>Stannis</entity> is the true king , as his own father died supporting his claim , revealing himself as the bastard son of <entity class="NE" id=8908>Eddard Stark</entity> . This makes <entity class="NE" id=8909>Stannis</entity> regard <entity class="NE" id=8910>Jon</entity> more seriously . <entity class="NE" id=8911>Stannis</entity> proclaims that <entity class="NE" id=8912>Eddard</entity> was an honorable man , and asks <entity class="NE" id=8913>Jon</entity> what <entity class="NE" id=8914>Ned</entity> would have done with <entity class="NE" id=8915>Mance</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8916>Jon</entity> responds that <entity class="NE" id=8917>Mance</entity> could have killed him or tortured him when he was his captive but instead he spared his life , so instead of killing Mance he should be taken prisoner and interrogated . Before they leave the wildling camp , <entity class="NE" id=8918>Jon</entity> also urges <entity class="NE" id=8919>Stannis</entity> to burn the dead before nightfall . <entity class="NE" id=8920>Melisandre</entity> looks through the flames , and sees Snow . Back at <entity class="NE" id=8921>Castle Black</entity> , a funeral is held for the slain members of the <entity class="NE" id=8922>Night's Watch</entity> , who have been arranged in a huge funeral pyre in the castle courtyard . <entity class="NE" id=8923>Maester Maester</entity> delivers a eulogy , saying that they died to protect the men , women , and children of the south who will never even know who they were , that it is the duty of the surviving black brothers to keep alive their memory . <entity class="NE" id=8924>Aemon</entity> closes his speech with the customary line , `` and now their watch has ended , '' which is repeated by the gathered men . <entity class="NE" id=8925>Samwell</entity> then aids <entity class="NE" id=8926>Aemon</entity> in setting the pyre alight , which is continued by <entity class="NE" id=8927>Jon</entity> and other men carrying torches . <entity class="NE" id=8928>Stannis</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8929>Davos</entity> look on , along with <entity class="NE" id=8930>Queen Selyse</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8931>Princess Shireen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8932>Jon</entity> looks across the flames and catches the gaze of <entity class="NE" id=8933>Melisandre</entity> , who is standing on the opposite side of the pyre . <entity class="NE" id=8934>Melisandre</entity> seems intrigued , her piercing stare clearly making <entity class="NE" id=8935>Jon</entity> uneasy . Afterwards , <entity class="NE" id=8936>Jon</entity> enters the chamber of the castle where <entity class="NE" id=8937>Tormund</entity> is being held . <entity class="NE" id=8938>Tormund</entity> asks why blind old <entity class="NE" id=8939>Maester Aemon</entity> patched up his arrow wounds , and <entity class="NE" id=8940>Jon</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=8941>Aemon</entity> is sworn to heal all wounded men , friend or foe . <entity class="NE" id=8942>Tormund</entity> asks if <entity class="NE" id=8943>Jon</entity> really loved <entity class="NE" id=8944>Ygritte</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8945>Jon</entity> does n't respond . <entity class="NE" id=8946>Tormund</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=8947>Ygritte</entity> truly loved him , and that he knew because although she never admitted it , she talked only of killing him , revealing her true feelings for him ( if she had n't loved him , she would n't have been so angered by his betrayal ) . Saddened , <entity class="NE" id=8948>Tormund</entity> implores <entity class="NE" id=8949>Jon</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=8950>Ygritte</entity> 's final resting place should be in `` the real north . '' <entity class="NE" id=8951>Jon</entity> then takes <entity class="NE" id=8952>Ygritte</entity> 's corpse to the north side of the <entity class="NE" id=8953>Wall</entity> and builds a funeral pyre for her near a sacred Heart tree . <entity class="NE" id=8954>Jon</entity> looks at his lover one last time and lights her pyre , and weeps silently as he turns his back and heads home . <entity class="NE" id=8955>Far</entity> to the north , <entity class="NE" id=8956>Bran Stark</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=8957>Reed</entity> children continue their journey to find the Three-eyed raven , though they are on the brink of exhaustion . <entity class="NE" id=8958>Jojen Jojen</entity> has grown sick and and he is barely able to stand , eventually collapsing into the snow . As <entity class="NE" id=8959>Meera</entity> begs <entity class="NE" id=8960>Jojen</entity> to gather what little strength he can muster to continue forward , <entity class="NE" id=8961>Bran</entity> calls out to them , revealing that they have found the massive heart tree that <entity class="NE" id=8961>Bran</entity> has seen in his visions . As they approach the tree , wights burst up from the snow , grabbing <entity class="NE" id=8962>Jojen</entity> 's ankles and attempting to drag him under the ice . These wights appear far older than those seen near the <entity class="NE" id=8963>Wall</entity> , appearing as ghastly skeletal warriors who move with surprising agility . <entity class="NE" id=8964>Meera</entity> attempts to defend <entity class="NE" id=8965>Jojen</entity> from the wights , but they begin to swarm over <entity class="NE" id=8966>Hodor</entity> , who is too scared to fight back . <entity class="NE" id=8967>Bran</entity> wargs into <entity class="NE" id=8968>Hodor</entity> 's mind and begins fighting off the wights with the aid of his direwolf Summer , but more wights keep bursting through the ice and they are quickly overwhelmed . Just as all seems lost , the wights around <entity class="NE" id=8969>Bran</entity> suddenly burst into fireballs , and he hears a young girl 's voice calling to him from a cave entrance at the base of the heart tree . Amidst the confusion <entity class="NE" id=8970>Jojen</entity> is repeatedly stabbed by a wight before <entity class="NE" id=8971>Meera</entity> can fight it off . The mysterious girl calls to <entity class="NE" id=8972>Meera</entity> and says that <entity class="NE" id=8973>Jojen</entity> is lost and that she must leave him if she wants to live . <entity class="NE" id=8974>Meera</entity> hesitates , but <entity class="NE" id=8975>Jojen</entity> urges her to save herself . <entity class="NE" id=8976>Crying</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8977>Meera</entity> slits her brother 's throat to grant him the mercy of a quick death . <entity class="NE" id=8978>Meera</entity> runs to the cave entrance along with <entity class="NE" id=8979>Bran</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8980>Hodor</entity> , and Summer while the mysterious child covers their retreat by magically throwing fireballs from her hands at the wights . Just as the life drains from <entity class="NE" id=8981>Jojen</entity> 's eyes , she launches a fireball at his body , immolating his corpse and preventing his return as a wight ( and fulfilling <entity class="NE" id=8981>Jojen</entity> 's vision that his death would involve fire ) . They run into the cave , pursued by the wights , who instantly shatter upon crossing the threshold of the cave . The little girl explains that the power which animates the dead corpses is powerless inside the cave . When <entity class="NE" id=8982>Bran</entity> asks who she is , she replies that `` the <entity class="NE" id=8983>First Men</entity> called us 'the <entity class="NE" id=8984>Children</entity> , but we were born long before them . '' <entity class="NE" id=8985>Bran</entity> realizes that she is one of the last surviving members of the <entity class="NE" id=8986>Children</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=8987>Forest</entity> , the original , non-human inhabitants of <entity class="NE" id=8988>Westeros</entity> who carved the faces into weirwood trees and taught the <entity class="NE" id=8989>First Men</entity> to worship the <entity class="NE" id=8990>Old Gods</entity> thousands of years ago . The child leads them deeper into the cave , which is overgrown with white weirwood roots from the massive tree above . Other Children of the <entity class="NE" id=8991>Forest</entity> peek out around corners as they advance . Finally , they arrive at a large central chamber , its floor littered with bones . In the middle of the cave is an old man seated in the middle of weirwood roots , which have grown around and even through much of his body . <entity class="NE" id=8992>Hodor</entity> places <entity class="NE" id=8993>Bran</entity> on the ground and <entity class="NE" id=8993>Bran</entity> crawls towards the old man , asking if he is the Three-eyed raven who appeared in his visions . The old man admits that he is , having taken several forms in the past , but his true form is before them now . <entity class="NE" id=8994>Meera</entity> is upset that her brother died to reach him , but the Three-eyed Raven says that <entity class="NE" id=8995>Jojen</entity> ( who possessed the <entity class="NE" id=8996>Greensight</entity> , as <entity class="NE" id=8997>Bran</entity> does ) always knew that he would die helping <entity class="NE" id=8997>Bran</entity> arrive here , but that he came nonetheless . He informs them that he has been watching all of them throughout their entire lives `` with a thousand eyes , and one . '' He continues by stating that <entity class="NE" id=8998>Jojen</entity> died so that <entity class="NE" id=8999>Bran</entity> could come here and regain what he has lost . <entity class="NE" id=9000>Bran</entity> asks if he means he will regain the use of his legs . The Three-eyed raven replies that <entity class="NE" id=9001>Bran</entity> will never walk again , `` but you will fly . `` . Across the <entity class="NE" id=9002>Narrow Sea</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=9003>Meereen</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9004>Queen Daenerys Targaryen</entity> sits in her throne room where she is receiving the day 's supplicants . An old man named <entity class="NE" id=9005>Fennesz</entity> approaches the throne , first speaking in <entity class="NE" id=9006>High</entity> Valyrian but then revealing that he also knows the <entity class="NE" id=9007>Common Tongue</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9008>Fennesz</entity> explains that he was not one of the slaves who toiled away at manual labor , but a well-educated teacher and servant to <entity class="NE" id=9009>Master Mighdal</entity> , who employed him as a teacher for his own children . He tells Daenarys that <entity class="NE" id=9010>Master Mighdal's</entity> seven year old daughter <entity class="NE" id=9011>Calla</entity> admires <entity class="NE" id=9012>Daenerys</entity> , having learned of the <entity class="NE" id=9013>Targaryen</entity> dynasty through <entity class="NE" id=9014>Fennesz</entity> 's teachings . As a servant of <entity class="NE" id=9015>Master Mighdal</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9016>Fennesz</entity> was well-treated and even well-respected in the household , but when <entity class="NE" id=9017>Daenerys</entity> forcibly freed all of the slaves in the city she did not understand the full-scale complications of suddenly having to care for so many people . <entity class="NE" id=9018>Fennesz</entity> originally stayed in <entity class="NE" id=9019>Master Mighdal</entity> 's house after she took the city , and <entity class="NE" id=9020>Mighdal</entity> 's children begged him to stay , but <entity class="NE" id=9020>Mighdal</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9018>Fennesz</entity> agreed that he must leave rather than face reprisals , forcing <entity class="NE" id=9018>Fennesz</entity> to become homeless . <entity class="NE" id=9021>Daenerys</entity> insists that she had established mess halls to feed the freed slaves and barracks to house them . <entity class="NE" id=9022>Fennez</entity> says that he has visited these refugee centers and they are not very safe : the young prey on the old , assaulting and robbing them . <entity class="NE" id=9023>Daenerys</entity> insists that her Unsullied will restore order , but <entity class="NE" id=9024>Fennesz</entity> points out that even assuming that they are able to ensure his physical safety , he has lost his livelihood and his purpose and is too old to start anew . Therefore , he has come to <entity class="NE" id=9025>Daenerys</entity> to beg her permission to sell himself back to <entity class="NE" id=9026>Mighdal</entity> . She is shocked that he would want to be owned as a slave again , as a man might own a goat or a chair . He implores her that the young may rejoice in her new world , but for those too old to change , there is only fear and squalor . Nor , he says , is he alone : there are many supplicants waiting outside lining up to make similar requests . <entity class="NE" id=9027>Daenerys</entity> is crestfallen , and says she did not liberate the slaves of <entity class="NE" id=9028>Meereen</entity> only to preside over the very injustice she sought to destroy , but surprisingly relents and admits that freedom means making one 's own choices . Therefore she will allow <entity class="NE" id=9029>Fennesz</entity> to enter into a labor contract with <entity class="NE" id=9030>Mighdal</entity> , but lasting no more than one year . He earnestly thanks her , and leaves . Ser Ser warns <entity class="NE" id=9031>Daenerys</entity> that the masters will assuredly take advantage of this , quickly making `` contracts '' with all of the displaced former slaves until they are all slaves again in all but name . The next supplicant then enters , a shepherd carrying a bundle in his arms , similarly to the herdsman who came to show the bones of their livestock which <entity class="NE" id=9032>Daenerys</entity> 's dragons burned in order to be reimbursed . The shepherd timidly approaches and states that he is unable to speak in the common tongue and requires <entity class="NE" id=9033>Missandei</entity> to translate . <entity class="NE" id=9034>Distraught</entity> , he tells Daenarys that the `` winged shadow '' came , placing the bundle on the ground and opening it to reveal charred bones - of a human child . <entity class="NE" id=9035>Daenerys</entity> 's largest dragon - the black one , <entity class="NE" id=9036>Drogon</entity> - has roasted the man 's three year old daughter <entity class="NE" id=9037>Zalla</entity> until this is all that was left of her . <entity class="NE" id=9038>Horrified</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9039>Daenerys</entity> meets with <entity class="NE" id=9040>Missandei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9041>Grey Worm</entity> in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the dragons are posing to the people of <entity class="NE" id=9042>Meereen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9043>Grey Grey</entity> reports that <entity class="NE" id=9044>Drogon</entity> was last seen flying over the <entity class="NE" id=9045>Black Cliffs</entity> three days ago , but he can no longer be found . Realizing that she can no longer control her dragons , <entity class="NE" id=9046>Daenerys</entity> tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the city . Later , she leads her remaining two dragons , <entity class="NE" id=9047>Rhaegal</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9048>Viserion</entity> , into the catacombs , where they are distracted by sheep carcasses . As they are feeding , <entity class="NE" id=9049>Daenerys</entity> personally locks huge iron collars around their necks , which are secured by heavy chains . She weeps as she does so , as it is symbolically reducing her remaining `` children '' to chained-up slaves themselves . <entity class="NE" id=9050>Daenerys</entity> wordlessly leaves and closes the huge stone door to the catacombs behind her as her dragons grow distressed and pathetically call after her when they attempt to follow and realize they are chained in place . In the <entity class="NE" id=9051>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=9052>Grand Maester M N</entity> 's laboratory in King's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=9053>Cersei</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9054>Pycelle</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=9055>Qyburn</entity> stand over <entity class="NE" id=9056>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> , who lies immobilized on a flat wooden table and is revealed to be suffering from a massive wound centered around his right side . <entity class="NE" id=9057>Pycelle</entity> informs <entity class="NE" id=9058>Cersei</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=9059>Oberyn Martell</entity> had coated his spear with manticore venom , poisoning <entity class="NE" id=9060>Ser Gregor</entity> . The effects are horrific , with <entity class="NE" id=9061>Gregor</entity> 's wounds putrefying and creating a terrible stench . <entity class="NE" id=9062>Pycelle</entity> says that he is beyond any hope of recovery , but <entity class="NE" id=9063>Qyburn</entity> insists to Cersei that he can save him using more unorthodox methods . <entity class="NE" id=9064>Pycelle</entity> chaffes at his suggestion , stating that he is not even a maester , and that such arrogance is what led to <entity class="NE" id=9065>Qyburn</entity> 's expulsion from the <entity class="NE" id=9066>Citadel</entity> in the first place , for experiments that were deemed both dangerous and `` unnatural . '' <entity class="NE" id=9067>Cersei</entity> , determined to save <entity class="NE" id=9068>Gregor</entity> from death , dismisses <entity class="NE" id=9069>Pycelle</entity> and orders Qyburn to do whatever is necessary , infuriating <entity class="NE" id=9069>Pycelle</entity> , who angrily shuffles out of the laboratory . She asks <entity class="NE" id=9070>Qyburn</entity> if his treatment will work , and <entity class="NE" id=9070>Qyburn</entity> claims that if his past work is any indicator , he stands a chance at saving <entity class="NE" id=9071>Gregor</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9072>Qyburn</entity> states that the process will `` change '' him , although <entity class="NE" id=9073>Cersei</entity> seems only concerned with whether it will weaken him , to which <entity class="NE" id=9072>Qyburn</entity> replies `` Oh no . '' <entity class="NE" id=9074>Cersei</entity> leaves , and <entity class="NE" id=9075>Qyburn</entity> begins syphoning out <entity class="NE" id=9076>Gregor</entity> 's tainted blood . <entity class="NE" id=9077>Cersei</entity> approaches <entity class="NE" id=9078>Tywin</entity> and insists that she will not submit to a forced marriage to <entity class="NE" id=9079>Ser Loras Tyrell</entity> . He attempts to dismiss the subject by stating that the matter is closed , but she persists and says that it is not just because she does not love Loras : he wants to ship her off to <entity class="NE" id=9080>Highgarden</entity> and remove her from the court entirely , keeping her away from her last remaining son . With <entity class="NE" id=9081>Cersei</entity> out of the picture , both Margaery and <entity class="NE" id=9082>Tywin</entity> will attempt to get their claws into <entity class="NE" id=9083>Tommen</entity> , each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance . <entity class="NE" id=9084>Tywin</entity> refuses to budge , so <entity class="NE" id=9085>Cersei</entity> plays her trump card : she threatens to destroy <entity class="HSE" id=9086>House Lannister</entity> by telling everyone the truth . <entity class="NE" id=9087>Tywin</entity> seems confused , and at first Cersei scoffs that he is merely feigning ignorance . With growing realization , she assesses that even the brilliant <entity class="NE" id=9088>Tywin Lannister</entity> never noticed what was going on between his own children , when all it would have taken was one attentive moment in the past twenty years . <entity class="NE" id=9089>Tywin</entity> is still apparently confused , so with a merciless grin <entity class="NE" id=9090>Cersei</entity> reveals that all of the rumors about her and <entity class="NE" id=9091>Jaime</entity> ( and their children ) are true – she will tell everyone and destroy <entity class="NE" id=9089>Tywin</entity> 's vaunted family legacy , even though it will also mean her death and <entity class="NE" id=9092>Tommen</entity> 's death . <entity class="NE" id=9093>Tywin</entity> shakes with barely constrained rage , but in denial he accuses that <entity class="NE" id=9094>Cersei</entity> is simply lying to anger him . <entity class="NE" id=9095>Cersei</entity> says she doubts he truly thinks that and leaves him standing in his chamber alone . <entity class="NE" id=9096>Cersei</entity> finds Jaime in the <entity class="NE" id=9097>White Sword Tower</entity> , and he expresses disgust at her blatant attempts to have <entity class="NE" id=9098>Tyrion</entity> killed . <entity class="NE" id=9099>Cersei</entity> asserts that <entity class="NE" id=9100>Tyrion</entity> killed their mother when she gave birth to him . <entity class="NE" id=9101>Jaime</entity> is surprised that she still irrationally blames him for that , pointing out that he was an infant and had no control over what happened . He insists that <entity class="NE" id=9102>Tyrion</entity> is her family , whether she chooses to accept it or not . She rebukes his claim , saying he is not her family and that they all have a choice , and that she chooses <entity class="NE" id=9103>Jaime</entity> . She then reveals that she has spilled their secret to <entity class="NE" id=9104>Tywin</entity> . He is stunned and concerned by her actions , asking how <entity class="NE" id=9105>Tywin</entity> reacted to the news , but she states that she does not want to discuss their father . She begins to seduce him , saying she chooses her brother over everyone else in the world , no longer concerned with whether anyone else knows their secret . He yields to her advances , kissing her passionately and throwing her on the table where they begin to have sex . In the middle of the night , <entity class="NE" id=9106>Tyrion</entity> is awoken in his cell by the sound of his cell door being opened by <entity class="NE" id=9107>Jaime</entity> , who reveals that he has orchestrated an escape plan for Tyrion with the assistance of <entity class="NE" id=9108>Varys</entity> , who has secured a galley in the harbor on which Tyrion can sneak out of the city and flee to the <entity class="NE" id=9109>Free Cities</entity> . He leads <entity class="NE" id=9110>Tyrion</entity> to a stairway leading up to a locked door , instructing <entity class="NE" id=9110>Tyrion</entity> to knock on it twice and then twice more to summon <entity class="NE" id=9111>Varys</entity> , who will lead him to the ship . Before they part ways , <entity class="NE" id=9112>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9113>Jaime</entity> share a tender embrace and say their goodbyes , unsure if either will ever see the other again . <entity class="NE" id=9114>Tyrion</entity> , alone , stares at the door at the top of the staircase , ultimately deciding to use the secret passages of the <entity class="NE" id=9115>Red Keep</entity> to infiltrate the Tower of the <entity class="NE" id=9116>Hand</entity> . He enters the <entity class="NE" id=9117>Hand</entity> of the King 's quarters , and sees a woman lying in <entity class="NE" id=9118>Tywin</entity> 's bed , with <entity class="NE" id=9118>Tywin</entity> 's clothes folded up on a chair . As he draws closer he sees that the woman is <entity class="NE" id=9119>Shae</entity> , who thinks it is <entity class="NE" id=9120>Tywin</entity> and calls out for him , calling him `` my lion '' as she had once done to <entity class="NE" id=9121>Tyrion</entity> . When she turns over and sees that it is <entity class="NE" id=9122>Tyrion</entity> , looking utterly betrayed , she grabs a knife to defend herself . <entity class="NE" id=9123>Tyrion</entity> could retreat but instead he rushes forward onto the bed to wrestle it from her grasp . <entity class="NE" id=9124>Tyrion</entity> manages to knock the knife from her hands and the two continue to struggle violently until <entity class="NE" id=9124>Tyrion</entity> manages to grab the necklace around her throat ( which he once gave her as a gift ) and strangles her with it . He continues to strangle her long after she has stopped resisting , until she is dead . He sinks to the floor and sits next to <entity class="NE" id=9125>Shae</entity> 's lifeless body , weeping , and tells her he 's sorry . He stares at the wall across the room and sees several weapons on display , among them <entity class="NE" id=9126>Joffrey</entity> 's old crossbow , and his expression quickly darkens . <entity class="NE" id=9127>Tyrion</entity> takes the crossbow down from the wall , loads it , and heads down the hall to the privy , opening the door to find his father seated upon the toilet . <entity class="NE" id=9128>Tywin</entity> seems surprised to see <entity class="NE" id=9129>Tyrion</entity> , but quickly regains composure and asks <entity class="NE" id=9129>Tyrion</entity> to lower the crossbow . He correctly deduces that <entity class="NE" id=9130>Jaime</entity> helped <entity class="NE" id=9131>Tyrion</entity> escape his cell , telling Tyrion that they can discuss the matter back in <entity class="NE" id=9132>Tywin</entity> 's chambers . However , when he attempts to stand , <entity class="NE" id=9133>Tyrion</entity> steadies the crossbow , stopping him dead in his tracks . `` All my life you 've wanted me dead , '' <entity class="NE" id=9134>Tyrion</entity> states , and <entity class="NE" id=9135>Tywin</entity> acknowledges the validity of his claim . He attempts to defuse the situation by telling Tyrion that despite this , <entity class="NE" id=9136>Tyrion</entity> has stubbornly clung to life , which <entity class="NE" id=9137>Tywin</entity> states he finds admirable and insists that he was never going to have <entity class="NE" id=9136>Tyrion</entity> actually killed . <entity class="NE" id=9138>Tyrion</entity> admits that he just murdered <entity class="NE" id=9139>Shae</entity> with his bare hands , but <entity class="NE" id=9140>Tywin</entity> scoffs that it does n't matter as she was nothing more than a whore . <entity class="NE" id=9141>Tyrion</entity> is angered by <entity class="NE" id=9142>Tywin</entity> 's indifference and raises the crossbow , threatening that if his father says the word `` whore '' one more time he will kill him . <entity class="NE" id=9143>Tywin</entity> balks that <entity class="NE" id=9144>Tyrion</entity> wo n't kill his own father in the privy , and again tries to convince Tyrion that they should continue to discuss this in his chambers . <entity class="NE" id=9145>Tyrion</entity> says he can not go back to <entity class="NE" id=9146>Tywin</entity> 's chambers because <entity class="NE" id=9147>Shae</entity> 's body is still there . <entity class="NE" id=9148>Tywin</entity> dares Tyrion by calling his bluff and mocking him by saying `` because you 're afraid of a dead whore ? `` . <entity class="NE" id=9149>Tyrion</entity> was not bluffing . The moment <entity class="NE" id=9150>Tywin</entity> utters the word `` whore '' again , <entity class="NE" id=9151>Tyrion</entity> looses his crossbow bolt , hitting <entity class="NE" id=9150>Tywin</entity> in the belly and knocking him backwards . <entity class="NE" id=9152>Tywin</entity> is incredulous that <entity class="NE" id=9153>Tyrion</entity> actually had the courage to fight back against him , and that he will die in such an undignified way at the hands of his hated dwarf son . As <entity class="NE" id=9154>Tyrion</entity> reloads the crossbow , <entity class="NE" id=9155>Tywin</entity> angrily declares that <entity class="NE" id=9154>Tyrion</entity> is no son of his . `` I am your son , '' Tyrion replies quietly , `` I have always been your son , '' and fires a second bolt into <entity class="NE" id=9156>Tywin</entity> 's heart , killing him . <entity class="NE" id=9157>Tyrion</entity> discards the crossbow as he leaves to find <entity class="NE" id=9158>Varys</entity> , who immediately realizes <entity class="NE" id=9157>Tyrion</entity> has done something terrible , exclaiming `` What have you done ? '' Nonetheless , he leads <entity class="NE" id=9159>Tyrion</entity> out of the castle to the docks where <entity class="NE" id=9159>Tyrion</entity> is stowed away inconspicuously in a crate aboard the ship . <entity class="NE" id=9160>Varys</entity> begins walking back towards the <entity class="NE" id=9161>Red Keep</entity> but stops when he hears the bells begin to toll , signaling the discovery of <entity class="NE" id=9162>Tywin</entity> 's body . Realizing that returning to the castle is likely unsafe , <entity class="NE" id=9163>Varys</entity> turns around and heads back for the ship , sitting next to <entity class="NE" id=9164>Tyrion</entity> 's crate in silence as they cast off for <entity class="NE" id=9165>Essos</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=9166>Vale</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=9167>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=9168>Tarth</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9169>Podrick Payne</entity> are heading towards the <entity class="NE" id=9170>Bloody Gate</entity> when they happen upon <entity class="NE" id=9171>Arya Stark</entity> practicing her water dancing while <entity class="NE" id=9172>Sandor Clegane</entity> is off relieving himself , both returning from the <entity class="NE" id=9173>Eyrie</entity> after receiving words of <entity class="NE" id=9174>Lysa Arryn</entity> 's death . <entity class="NE" id=9175>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9176>Arya</entity> converse for a moment , both showing respect for one another as they are both women who have fought against what has been expected of them their entire lives . They are interrupted by the return of the <entity class="NE" id=9177>Hound</entity> , who is immediately recognized by <entity class="NE" id=9178>Podrick</entity> , causing <entity class="NE" id=9179>Brienne</entity> to realize that the girl is <entity class="NE" id=9180>Arya</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9181>Brienne</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=9182>Arya</entity> of her sacred vow to protect her mother , although she failed to do so because she was sent by her mother to return <entity class="NE" id=9183>Jaime Lannister</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=9184>Hound</entity> immediately accuses <entity class="NE" id=9185>Brienne</entity> of working for the <entity class="NE" id=9186>Lannisters</entity> , noticing her <entity class="NE" id=9187>Valyrian</entity> steel sword <entity class="NE" id=9188>Oathkeeper</entity> , which <entity class="NE" id=9185>Brienne</entity> admits was given to her by <entity class="NE" id=9189>Jaime</entity> , frightening <entity class="NE" id=9190>Arya</entity> into thinking that <entity class="NE" id=9185>Brienne</entity> is working for the <entity class="NE" id=9186>Lannisters</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9191>Brienne</entity> implores <entity class="NE" id=9192>Arya</entity> to come with her to safety , causing the <entity class="NE" id=9193>Hound</entity> to mock <entity class="NE" id=9191>Brienne</entity> , pointing out that there is no `` safety '' for <entity class="NE" id=9192>Arya</entity> anymore : her aunt <entity class="NE" id=9194>Lysa Arryn</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=9195>Eyrie –</entity> whom <entity class="NE" id=9191>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9196>Podrick</entity> are seeking out – is dead , as are her father , mother , and older brother , while the Stark armies are scattered and <entity class="NE" id=9197>Winterfell</entity> is a smoking ruin . They draw swords and begin fighting , both eventually disarming each other and resorting to brutally fighting each other in <entity class="NE" id=9198>hand-to-hand</entity> combat . Ultimately , <entity class="NE" id=9199>Brienne</entity> gains the upper hand ( by biting off a chunk of <entity class="NE" id=9200>Sandor</entity> 's ear ) and knocks him down a cliff side . <entity class="NE" id=9201>Brienne</entity> goes to search for <entity class="NE" id=9202>Arya</entity> , who slipped away during the melee and has hidden herself amongst the rock formations . As <entity class="NE" id=9203>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9204>Podrick</entity> search the surrounding area for Arya in vain , <entity class="NE" id=9205>Arya</entity> makes her way down the cliff side to find the <entity class="NE" id=9206>Hound</entity> badly wounded . He tells her that unless there is a maester miraculously on hand to tend to his wounds , he 's finished . <entity class="NE" id=9207>Sandor</entity> tells her to kill him and scratch another name off her list , but she just sits and stares at him silently . He grows angry and begins recounting running down the butcher 's boy and how he should have raped <entity class="NE" id=9208>Sansa</entity> in <entity class="NE" id=9209>King</entity> 's Landing in an attempt to goad <entity class="NE" id=9210>Arya</entity> into killing him in anger , but she remains silent . <entity class="NE" id=9211>Sandor</entity> finally begs her to kill him and put him out of his misery , but she quietly refuses and takes his money purse , leaving him screaming at her to kill him as she silently walks away . <entity class="NE" id=9212>Arya</entity> rides a horse to the nearby coast of the <entity class="NE" id=9213>Vale</entity> , where she sees a wharf with ships docked . She approaches a captain and asks if she can pay for travel to the <entity class="NE" id=9214>North</entity> , but he says that they wo n't go there because these days the <entity class="NE" id=9214>North</entity> is full of war , cold , and pirates . Instead , the ship is going `` home '' : to the <entity class="NE" id=9215>Free City</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=9216>Braavos</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=9217>Arya</entity> remembers the special coin that the <entity class="NE" id=9218>Faceless Man</entity> known as <entity class="NE" id=9219>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> gave her , and instructed her to present to any man from <entity class="NE" id=9220>Braavos</entity> if she needed aid . She does so now , and the captain is utterly surprised at how she obtained it , but she says only `` Valar morghulis '' ( as <entity class="NE" id=9221>Jaqen</entity> instructed ) , to which the captain gives the traditional response , `` Valar dohaeris . '' He warmly welcomes her aboard the ship , and insists that she will have her own cabin . As the ship casts off , <entity class="NE" id=9222>Arya</entity> stands aboard the ship and watches as the shore of <entity class="NE" id=9223>Westeros</entity> shrinks further and further away . She then moves to the prow of the ship , looking forward across the <entity class="NE" id=9224>Narrow Sea</entity> in the direction of the <entity class="NE" id=9225>Free Cities</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=9226>Braavos</entity> .
