Jon’s warnings about the Wall’s vulnerability fall on deaf ears . <entity class="NE" id=8196>Brienne</entity> follows a new lead on the road with <entity class="NE" id=8197>Pod</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=8198>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=8199>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8200>Bronn</entity> . In his cell , <entity class="NE" id=8201>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8202>Jaime discuss Tyrion</entity> 's fate and the irony of <entity class="NE" id=8203>Lord Tywin</entity> striking down both his heirs if <entity class="NE" id=8204>Jaime</entity> were to die being <entity class="NE" id=8201>Tyrion</entity> 's champion ; Jaime declines to be <entity class="NE" id=8201>Tyrion</entity> 's champion as he can not fight well enough with his left hand . <entity class="NE" id=8205>Tyrion</entity> then requests <entity class="NE" id=8206>Jaime</entity> to bring him <entity class="NE" id=8207>Bronn</entity> , hoping the sellsword will stand for him just as he did at the <entity class="NE" id=8208>Eyrie</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8209>Bronn</entity> visits Tyrion in the clothes of a lord , having been betrothed to <entity class="NE" id=8210>Lollys Stokeworth</entity> , by <entity class="NE" id=8211>Cersei</entity> 's doing . He refuses to fight the <entity class="NE" id=8212>Mountain</entity> ( whom <entity class="NE" id=8213>Cersei</entity> has chosen for her champion ) , both for lack of a reward and believing <entity class="NE" id=8214>Clegane</entity> is too dangerous for him to face , and bids farewell to <entity class="NE" id=8215>Tyrion</entity> , who while heartbroken by <entity class="NE" id=8216>Bronn</entity> 's decision , understands . <entity class="NE" id=8217>Oberyn</entity> visits Tyrion in his cell . Later , <entity class="NE" id=8218>Tyrion</entity> is approached by <entity class="NE" id=8219>Oberyn Martell</entity> , who tells Tyrion of his disappointment in their first encounter : as children , <entity class="NE" id=8220>Oberyn</entity> and his sister <entity class="NE" id=8221>Elia</entity> were told stories of the `` <entity class="NE" id=8222>Lannister Monster</entity> '' and his extreme deformities . During a childhood visit to <entity class="NE" id=8223>Casterly Rock</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8224>Cersei</entity> showed <entity class="NE" id=8225>Tyrion</entity> , with great ceremony , to <entity class="NE" id=8226>Oberyn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8227>Elia</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8228>Oberyn</entity> tells Tyrion that he saw no monster , just a baby . <entity class="NE" id=8229>Cersei</entity> told <entity class="NE" id=8230>Oberyn</entity> and his sister that <entity class="NE" id=8231>Tyrion</entity> killed her mother , and then cruelly assaulted <entity class="NE" id=8231>Tyrion</entity> until <entity class="NE" id=8232>Jaime</entity> stopped her . <entity class="NE" id=8233>Oberyn</entity> says that he and <entity class="NE" id=8234>Elia</entity> were quite disturbed at <entity class="NE" id=8235>Cersei</entity> 's already strong hatred toward <entity class="NE" id=8236>Tyrion</entity> , who is disturbed by <entity class="NE" id=8235>Cersei</entity> 's relentless hatred as his eyes tear up . <entity class="NE" id=8237>Oberyn</entity> tells Tyrion that he seeks justice for the death of his sister , and <entity class="NE" id=8238>Tyrion</entity> replies , `` You are in the wrong place . '' <entity class="NE" id=8239>Oberyn</entity> counters that he is in the perfect place ; all those he means to bring to justice for his sister 's murder are close at hand . Intending to start his revenge with <entity class="NE" id=8240>Gregor Clegane</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8241>Oberyn</entity> offers his service as <entity class="NE" id=8242>Tyrion</entity> 's champion in the coming trial by combat . <entity class="NE" id=8243>Gregor Gregor</entity> , known by most as 'the <entity class="NE" id=8244>Mountain</entity> , ' is mercilessly killing prisoners with a greatsword . <entity class="NE" id=8245>Cersei</entity> approaches him and thanks him for his haste in returning to <entity class="NE" id=8246>King</entity> 's Landing as her champion for the trial by combat . <entity class="NE" id=8247>Gregor</entity> asks who he will be fighting , <entity class="NE" id=8248>Cersei</entity> asks if it matters , and he shakes his head . Across the <entity class="NE" id=8249>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8250>Daario</entity> visits <entity class="NE" id=8251>Daenerys</entity> in her private chambers . <entity class="NE" id=8252>Daenerys</entity> is surprised by <entity class="NE" id=8253>Daario</entity> in her private chambers . She feigns outrage at the intrusion , but agrees to hear his complaints . <entity class="NE" id=8254>Daario</entity> laments that he is only good at two things , killing men and sleeping with women , and that he has no opportunities to pursue either strength . <entity class="NE" id=8255>Dany</entity> counters that the <entity class="NE" id=8256>Second Sons</entity> are currently acting as <entity class="NE" id=8257>Meereen</entity> 's police force and that there are many women in the city who would throw themselves at him ; <entity class="NE" id=8258>Daario</entity> dismisses the <entity class="NE" id=8256>Second Sons</entity> ' role as unchallenging and says the only woman he wants is n't interested . He begs <entity class="NE" id=8259>Daenerys</entity> to send him and the <entity class="NE" id=8260>Second Sons</entity> to make real war . <entity class="NE" id=8261>Dany</entity> focuses on <entity class="NE" id=8262>Daario</entity> 's other proclaimed talent and orders him to remove his clothes . The following morning , <entity class="NE" id=8263>Daario</entity> bumps into <entity class="NE" id=8264>Ser Jorah</entity> . He also says that it 's a good time to talk to the queen , as she is in a very good mood , implying that he and <entity class="NE" id=8265>Daenerys</entity> had just been intimate . <entity class="NE" id=8266>Jorah</entity> is not amused , but <entity class="NE" id=8267>Daenerys</entity> dismisses concerns about her intimate life . <entity class="NE" id=8268>Daenerys</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=8269>Jorah</entity> that she sent <entity class="NE" id=8270>Daario</entity> to take the <entity class="NE" id=8271>Second Sons</entity> to Yunkai to regain control over the city and kill the masters that have resurfaced . <entity class="NE" id=8272>Jorah</entity> relates to the mercy shown by <entity class="NE" id=8273>Eddard Stark</entity> for his dealings in slavery and convinces <entity class="NE" id=8274>Daenerys</entity> to bring the masters to justice without execution . <entity class="NE" id=8275>Daenerys</entity> considers for a moment and then tells <entity class="NE" id=8276>Jorah</entity> to assign <entity class="NE" id=8277>Hizdahr zo Loraq</entity> as her ambassador to offer the masters a choice : they can live free in the new world she wants to create , or they can die clinging to their old one . The <entity class="NE" id=8278>Second Sons</entity> will be stationed in <entity class="NE" id=8279>Yunkai</entity> to enforce whichever choice the masters make . She also says to let <entity class="NE" id=8280>Daario</entity> know that it was <entity class="NE" id=8281>Jorah</entity> who changed her mind . At <entity class="NE" id=8282>Dragonstone</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8283>Selyse</entity> speaks with <entity class="NE" id=8284>Melisandre</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8285>Queen Queen</entity> speaks to <entity class="NE" id=8286>Melisandre</entity> , who is enjoying a bath . She quips that the <entity class="NE" id=8287>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=8288>Light</entity> told her to enjoy it as it was the last time she would have a good bath , but the joke goes over <entity class="NE" id=8289>Selyse</entity> 's head . To cement <entity class="NE" id=8290>Selyse</entity> 's position as <entity class="NE" id=8291>Melisandre</entity> 's most devoted follower , the <entity class="NE" id=8292>Red Priestess</entity> tells her about using potions and illusions in serving the <entity class="NE" id=8293>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=8294>Light</entity> and that a bit of pageantry and deception in helping converts see the truth will be forgiven later on . <entity class="NE" id=8295>Selyse</entity> asks her if she used the potions when she slept with <entity class="NE" id=8296>Stannis</entity> , to which she replies that she did not . <entity class="NE" id=8297>Selyse</entity> then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter <entity class="NE" id=8298>Shireen</entity> behind when they go to the <entity class="NE" id=8299>North</entity> but <entity class="NE" id=8300>Melisandre</entity> is as dismissive about Shireen's '' heresy '' as she always is , and assures <entity class="NE" id=8297>Selyse</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=8298>Shireen</entity> will be needed where they are going . At the <entity class="NE" id=8301>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8302>Jon</entity> and his fellow brothers return from <entity class="NE" id=8303>Craster</entity> 's Keep . At first sight of his direwolf , <entity class="NE" id=8304>Ghost</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8305>Alliser Thorne</entity> sends his `` beast '' away , outside <entity class="NE" id=8306>Castle Black</entity> . Afterwards , <entity class="NE" id=8307>Jon</entity> tries to convince the <entity class="NE" id=8308>Night's Watch</entity> to barricade the <entity class="NE" id=8309>Wall</entity> against the imminent wildling invasion by blocking off <entity class="NE" id=8310>Castle Black</entity> 's entry tunnel with ice and rock . He is denied after being reminded of his place in the <entity class="NE" id=8311>Watch</entity> , when the <entity class="NE" id=8312>First Builder</entity> reluctantly agrees with <entity class="NE" id=8313>Thorne</entity> 's assessment of their chances of defending the tunnel . <entity class="NE" id=8314>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8315>Sam</entity> are sent to serve as sentries on top of the <entity class="NE" id=8316>Wall</entity> until <entity class="NE" id=8317>Mance</entity> arrives . In the <entity class="NE" id=8318>Riverlands</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8319>Arya</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8320>Sandor</entity> encounter a ​dying man in a ransacked village . <entity class="NE" id=8321>Sandor</entity> gives the man a gift of mercy by stabbing him in the heart . <entity class="NE" id=8322>Sandor</entity> is ambushed by <entity class="NE" id=8323>Biter</entity> , and is bitten on the neck . He snaps <entity class="NE" id=8324>Biter</entity> 's neck and drops him dead in the dirt . <entity class="NE" id=8325>Rorge</entity> encounters them and after a short interrogation is killed by <entity class="NE" id=8326>Arya</entity> with a quick thrust by <entity class="NE" id=8327>Needle</entity> to his heart . <entity class="NE" id=8328>Afterward</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8329>Sandor</entity> clumsily addresses his wounds from <entity class="NE" id=8330>Biter</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8331>Arya</entity> suggests burning to cauterize the wound , but is rebuffed by <entity class="NE" id=8332>Sandor</entity> 's fear of fire . <entity class="NE" id=8333>Sandor</entity> confirms the story of his facial scars from burns inflicted by <entity class="NE" id=8334>Gregor</entity> 's wrath and how his father covered up the truth , making him feel alone . <entity class="NE" id=8335>Arya</entity> offers to clean and stitch him up , and <entity class="NE" id=8336>Sandor</entity> allows her to . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=8337>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8338>Podrick</entity> stop at an inn where they are served kidney pie made by none other than <entity class="NE" id=8339>Hot Pie</entity> , who proceeds to tell them at length the process in finding the right ingredients . He then asks of <entity class="NE" id=8340>Brienne</entity> 's business , to which she replies that she is in <entity class="NE" id=8341>Lady Stark</entity> 's service to find and protect <entity class="NE" id=8342>Sansa Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8343>Hot Hot</entity> leaves after addressing the <entity class="NE" id=8344>Starks</entity> as traitors . As <entity class="NE" id=8345>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8346>Podrick</entity> prepare to leave the inn , <entity class="NE" id=8346>Podrick</entity> reminds <entity class="NE" id=8345>Brienne</entity> that telling people of their quest could be dangerous , but <entity class="NE" id=8345>Brienne</entity> 's honesty is swiftly rewarded when <entity class="NE" id=8347>Hot Pie</entity> approaches and gives them a loaf of bread shaped like a wolf . He tells them that he knows nothing of <entity class="NE" id=8348>Sansa</entity> , but has seen her sister Arya alive , along with the <entity class="NE" id=8349>Hound</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8350>Brienne</entity> is surprised because <entity class="NE" id=8351>Arya</entity> has been presumed dead since she disappeared when her father <entity class="NE" id=8352>Ned</entity> was executed . They deduce that <entity class="NE" id=8353>Arya</entity> 's captors are probably going to try to ransom <entity class="NE" id=8353>Arya</entity> somewhere . Having memorized the complex family trees of the <entity class="NE" id=8354>Great Houses</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8355>Podrick</entity> surmises that <entity class="NE" id=8356>Arya</entity> 's aunt <entity class="NE" id=8357>Lysa Arryn</entity> is the <entity class="NE" id=8358>Hound</entity> 's only remaining chance of a reward for her . Therefore , <entity class="NE" id=8359>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8360>Podrick</entity> decide to head for the <entity class="NE" id=8361>Eyrie</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=8362>Eyrie</entity> . While wandering the <entity class="NE" id=8363>Eyrie</entity> 's snow-covered courtyards , <entity class="NE" id=8364>Sansa</entity> builds a snow replica of <entity class="NE" id=8365>Winterfell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8366>Robin</entity> chances upon her and seems impressed with her efforts . The cousins get along until <entity class="NE" id=8367>Robin</entity> asks where the <entity class="NE" id=8368>Moon Door</entity> is . <entity class="NE" id=8369>Sansa</entity> tells him <entity class="NE" id=8370>Winterfell</entity> does n't need a <entity class="NE" id=8371>Moon Door</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8372>Sansa</entity> agrees to add one , but in the process , <entity class="NE" id=8373>Robin</entity> accidentally knocks over a tower . <entity class="NE" id=8374>Robin</entity> insists she replicate the tower . This irritates <entity class="NE" id=8375>Sansa</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8376>Robin</entity> throws a tantrum in response . <entity class="NE" id=8377>Unable</entity> to control her anger , <entity class="NE" id=8378>Sansa</entity> slaps <entity class="NE" id=8379>Robin</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8380>Sansa</entity> immediately softens and tries to apologize , but before she can Robin threatens to tell his mother and runs away . <entity class="NE" id=8381>Petyr Petyr</entity> witnesses the action and assures <entity class="NE" id=8382>Sansa</entity> that he will deal with <entity class="NE" id=8383>Lysa</entity> , whom he says should discipline her child more often , anyway . <entity class="NE" id=8384>Petyr</entity> muses on how he should have been <entity class="NE" id=8385>Sansa</entity> 's father , but then tells <entity class="NE" id=8385>Sansa</entity> that she is more beautiful than her mother <entity class="NE" id=8386>Catelyn</entity> and kisses <entity class="NE" id=8385>Sansa</entity> ; who is so shocked that she does n't resist . Unknown to the pair , the kiss is seen by <entity class="NE" id=8387>Lysa</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8388>Lysa</entity> is pushed out the <entity class="NE" id=8389>Moon Door</entity> . Later , <entity class="NE" id=8390>Sansa</entity> is summoned by <entity class="NE" id=8391>Lysa</entity> , who proceeds to explain the gory details about <entity class="NE" id=8392>Moon Door</entity> executions . <entity class="NE" id=8393>Lysa</entity> then grabs <entity class="NE" id=8394>Sansa</entity> and threatens to throw her out for kissing <entity class="NE" id=8395>Petyr</entity> . She is stopped when <entity class="NE" id=8396>Petyr</entity> arrives and swears by everything he can think of that he will send <entity class="NE" id=8397>Sansa</entity> away . <entity class="NE" id=8398>Lysa</entity> releases <entity class="NE" id=8399>Sansa</entity> and embraces <entity class="NE" id=8400>Petyr</entity> , who assures <entity class="NE" id=8398>Lysa</entity> that he only ever loved one woman - her sister . <entity class="NE" id=8401>Lysa</entity> has only an instant to contemplate this betrayal , as <entity class="NE" id=8402>Petyr</entity> shoves her out of the <entity class="NE" id=8403>Moon Door</entity> and looks down as she plummets to her death hundreds of feet below .
