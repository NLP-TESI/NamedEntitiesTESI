The <entity class="NE" id=8600>Night's Watch</entity> , although hopelessly outnumbered , attempts to defend <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> from <entity class="NE" id=8602>Mance Rayder</entity> 's massive wildling army , who plan to siege the fortress from the north . Meanwhile , a secret garrison of wildlings including <entity class="NE" id=8603>Tormund</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> are poised to launch a surprise attack from the south of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> . ​​Jon and <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> are standing watch atop the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> , staring out into the darkness of the north and awaiting the imminent wildling invasion . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> attempts to interrogate <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> about what it was like to be with a woman , stating that as their deaths are likely imminent , it may be his last chance to find out . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> brings up that the vows of the <entity class="NE" id=8600>Night's Watch</entity> only explicitly forbid members from taking wives or producing children , and that other `` activities '' are open to interpretation . <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> replies glumly that <entity class="NE" id=8614>Alliser Thorne</entity> most likely does not care about their interpretations . When further pressed by <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> to describe lying down with <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> attempts to explain but is unable to properly express it , proclaiming exasperatedly that he 's `` not a bleeding poet . `` . <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> offers to take the watch up alone so <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> can go below , and as <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> steps into the elevator and begins to descend the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> , an owl lands on top of the wall and begins hooting loudly . The owl is revealed to be controlled by a Thenn warg who is a member of the garrison of wildlings under command of <entity class="NE" id=8603>Tormund</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> , who have set up camp just outside of the southern entrance to <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8603>Tormund</entity> boasts about a bear he supposedly had sex with , prompting <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> to cut him short and cast her doubts on the validity of his claim . She tells him that she only cares about getting as many arrows through the hearts of `` crows '' as possible . She angrily talks about how the people south of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> shut the the wildlings out by building it and hunting the wildlings as enemies ; she says that now the wildlings are the hunters and the southerners their prey . <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> mockingly replies that <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> has more words about killing than she has arrows . She defends herself by saying she killed just as many people at <entity class="NE" id=8629>Mole</entity> 's Town as he , but <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> replies that none of them was her former lover . He further mocks her by saying that when she sees him , she 'll likely just serve him a slice of `` ginger minge , '' causing her to jump to her feet in anger . <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> stares <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> down , claiming that she wants to kill <entity class="NE" id=8633>Jon Snow</entity> herself , then looks around the camp and warns the others that she has an arrow ready for anyone else who attempts to kill him . Just outside the camp , a shaded person cradling something passes by the wildlings unnoticed . <entity class="NE" id=8634>Maester Maester</entity> finds <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> library . ​Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> is caught reading a book about wildlings by <entity class="NE" id=8638>Maester Aemon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8639>Aemon</entity> correctly guesses that <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> is reading the book because he wants to know what kind of fate might have befallen Gilly if she fell into wildling hands during the sack of <entity class="NE" id=8629>Mole</entity> 's Town . He also surmises that <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> has shown such a keen interest in her fate because he is in love with her , despite <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> 's protests to the contrary . <entity class="NE" id=8639>Aemon</entity> muses about the girl he once loved , stating that he can still picture her as clear as day and that she is more real than <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> is . After being dismissed by <entity class="NE" id=8639>Aemon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> leaves the maester's chambers only to hear <entity class="NE" id=8647>Gilly</entity> at the gate begging to be allowed inside , revealing her survival of the <entity class="NE" id=8629>Mole</entity> 's Town massacre and her identity as the cloaked figure approaching <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8650>Pypar</entity> attempts to deny her passage into the castle , saying he is not allowed to open the gate under any circumstances . However , <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> roars at <entity class="NE" id=8652>Pyp</entity> to allow her in , causing <entity class="NE" id=8652>Pyp</entity> to relent and let her in . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> promises <entity class="NE" id=8647>Gilly</entity> wherever she goes next he will go too , but their reunion is cut short by two blows from the horn , indicating that Mance's wildling army has finally begun their assault . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> rushes to get <entity class="NE" id=8647>Gilly</entity> safely inside the castle while other brothers of the <entity class="NE" id=8600>Night's Watch</entity> prepare for the imminent attack by wildlings . Jon looking off the top of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> . On top of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> hears the horn blowing and looks north , witnessing a tremendous conflagration to the <entity class="NE" id=8661>North</entity> , just as <entity class="NE" id=8662>Mance</entity> had promised . <entity class="NE" id=8663>South</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> , the Thenn warg 's owl also spots the fire and informs <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8603>Tormund</entity> that the time has come to attack <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> approaches <entity class="NE" id=8669>Ser Alliser Thorne</entity> , who finally relents and admits that they should have heeded <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> 's advice and blocked the gates . He grimly muses that leadership often means being second-guessed by `` every clever little twat with a mouth '' and when a man in charge second-guesses himself , all is doomed . Steeling himself for the impending siege , <entity class="NE" id=8670>Thorne</entity> begins barking orders to the archers , preparing them to fire upon the attackers massing below . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8647>Gilly</entity> share a kiss . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> brings Gilly​ and her baby to a storage room where she can hide . <entity class="NE" id=8647>Gilly</entity> wants <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> to stay with her as he promised , but he can not as he swore to defend the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> as a brother of the <entity class="NE" id=8600>Night's Watch</entity> . Before he leaves her , <entity class="NE" id=8647>Gilly</entity> begs <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> to promise her that he wo n't die and the two finally share a kiss . As <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> and Pypar are preparing arrows at the southern gate , <entity class="NE" id=8650>Pypar</entity> laments that he has never seen a real battle before or ever even held an edged blade . <entity class="NE" id=8650>Pypar</entity> asks how <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> is not afraid , but <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> replies that he is , as there are thousands of wildlings about to overrun them . <entity class="NE" id=8650>Pypar</entity> asks how he managed to kill a <entity class="NE" id=8685>White Walker</entity> while being afraid , and <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> says that at that moment , he just had to do something or <entity class="NE" id=8647>Gilly</entity> would have been killed and her baby would have been taken . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> further explains that at that moment , he was n't himself ; he was nothing , and when you are nothing there is nothing to be afraid of . However , he explains the reason he is afraid now is because `` I 'm not nothing anymore . `` . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> spies on the <entity class="NE" id=8690>Castle</entity> to scout numbers of defenders . She tells the other wildlings that most of the guards are at the top of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> and that few are left in the <entity class="NE" id=8690>Castle</entity> . The group immediately take off towards <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> 's southern gate , while <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> seems to have second thoughts . <entity class="NE" id=8661>North</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> , the massive wildling army emerges from the woods , their numbers including giants riding atop mammoths . <entity class="NE" id=8697>Alliser</entity> orders the archers on the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> to nock their arrows , but they draw instead while <entity class="NE" id=8699>Grenn</entity> accidentally drops a barrel down the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8697>Alliser</entity> angrily drills his men on properly following orders when another horn blows from down below at <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> , signalling the unanticipated appearance of Tormund's band of wildlings at the castle 's southern entrance . Realizing the dire need for experienced men to defend the keep from the surprise attack , <entity class="NE" id=8697>Alliser</entity> orders <entity class="NE" id=8703>Janos Slynt</entity> to assume command of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> 's defenses and heads below to join the melee . Below , <entity class="NE" id=8603>Tormund</entity> and Styr's forces charge the gate while <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> , acting as a sniper , manages to pick off several men defending the gate with her bow . <entity class="NE" id=8650>Pypar</entity> is firing a crossbow as <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> assists by reloading another crossbow , but Pypar's aim is poor due to inexperience and nerves and he repeatedly misses his shots . The band of wildlings manage to reach <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> 's walls and begin scaling them using grappling hooks and ropes , forcing <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8652>Pyp</entity> to retreat . <entity class="NE" id=8712>Alliser Alliser</entity> arrives with reinforcements from the top of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> via the wooden lift system , which is being operated by <entity class="NE" id=8714>Olly</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8697>Alliser</entity> gives an impassioned speech , promising that the ancient order of the <entity class="NE" id=8600>Night's Watch</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> will survive this battle . His speech rallies the black brothers and <entity class="NE" id=8697>Alliser</entity> personally leads the charge against the wildlings who have breached <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> 's defenses , causing an intense battle to erupt in the courtyard . ​​On the northern side of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> , a wildling strike force led by two giants ( one of which is riding a mammoth ) charge towards <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> 's outer gate . On top of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8703>Janos Slynt</entity> , having no true leadership experience , breaks down at the sight of the massive wildling army and begins fumbling his orders . <entity class="NE" id=8699>Grenn</entity> steps in by falsely claiming that <entity class="NE" id=8697>Alliser</entity> needs <entity class="NE" id=8726>Janos</entity> back down below . <entity class="NE" id=8726>Janos</entity> believes the lie and leaves , allowing <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> to take command of the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> 's defenses . The black brothers continue to rain down arrows on the advancing wildlings , even killing ones that are attempting to scale the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> . One giant , armed with a massive bow , manages to fire a huge arrow at one of the bunkers atop the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> , completely obliterating it and killing the black brother manning it -- the force of the giant 's arrow carries the black brother off the wall on to the other side where he is shoved into ground with a tremendous amount of force . <entity class="NE" id=8732>Hobb</entity> takes up his butcher 's knife to defend the dining hall . Down in <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> , the battle rages on between the wildlings and the <entity class="NE" id=8600>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> continue to slay numerous black brothers . At one point , a group of wildlings breach <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> 's dining hall . One wildling is killed when a black brother throws boiling stew in his face and beats him to death with the pot . <entity class="NE" id=8732>Hobb</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> 's cook , calmly enters the dining hall and kills a wildling with his massive butcher 's knife . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=8703>Janos Slynt</entity> cowardly retreats to a storage room where he discovers Gilly and her baby . <entity class="NE" id=8741>Samwell Samwell</entity> comforts <entity class="NE" id=8650>Pypar</entity> as he dies . Pyp​ manages to kill a wildling with his crossbow , but is then shot through the neck by <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> comforts <entity class="NE" id=8652>Pyp</entity> and stays with him until he dies . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> is forced to leave <entity class="NE" id=8652>Pyp</entity> 's body and as he heads to <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> 's lift system , but he is spotted by the Thenn warg . The warg charges at <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> as he desperately attempts to load his crossbow , managing to do so and firing a bolt into the warg 's head just before he reaches him . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=8614>Alliser Thorne</entity> is locked in a vicious duel with <entity class="NE" id=8603>Tormund</entity> on the catwalks of <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> , both seemingly evenly matched in skill . However , <entity class="NE" id=8670>Thorne</entity> suffers a grievous wound and is forced to retreat , being dragged to safety as he continues to shout orders to his men . <entity class="NE" id=8754>Mag Mag</entity> charges <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> 's inner gate . The black brothers defending the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> manage to repel most of the wildlings attacking the outer gate , but one giant manages to make it through , greatly weakening the gate by repeatedly smashing it with his fists and managing to singlehandedly begin lifting the gate . <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> , knowing the inner gate wo n't hold against the massive giant , sends a group of black brothers led by <entity class="NE" id=8699>Grenn</entity> to hold it at any cost . Arriving at the inner gate , <entity class="NE" id=8759>Hill</entity> cowers when faced by the giant charging at them , but <entity class="NE" id=8699>Grenn</entity> bolsters his and the others courage by reciting the <entity class="NE" id=8600>Night's Watch</entity> oath . The black brothers ready their weapons just as the giant slams himself into the inner gate . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> arrives atop the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> to ask <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> for more men to defend the castle , and <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> tasks <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> with releasing Ghost from his pen to assist in the fighting . <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> descends the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> and finally enters the fray , quickly dispatching several wildlings and catching the attention of <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> ; the two meet in a single combat . <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> eventually gets the upper hand by knocking <entity class="NE" id=8769>Longclaw</entity> away and brutally assaulting <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> , smashing his face into an anvil and tossing him into the blacksmith 's forge . <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> picks <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> up and begins strangling him , but <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> spits blood in <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> 's face and distracts him long enough for <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> to grab the blacksmith 's hammer lying next to him and buries it in <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> 's skull . <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> holds a dying <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> . Upon killing <entity class="NE" id=8604>Styr</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> turns around to find <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> pointing her bow at him with an arrow drawn . He smiles at her , causing <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> to hesitate . Before either can say anything , <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> is shot near the heart by an arrow fired from <entity class="NE" id=8714>Olly</entity> , avenging the death of his father at <entity class="NE" id=8605>Ygritte</entity> 's hands during the wildling attack on his village . <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> holds her in his arms as she tells him that they should have never left the cave , and they lament circumstances that prevented them from being together as she succumbs to her wound . <entity class="NE" id=8603>Tormund</entity> makes a last stand before he is subdued by <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=8600>Night's Watch</entity> . Atop the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=8786>Eddison Tollett</entity> , who <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> left in command of the defenses , orders the men to drop the 'scythe . ' A huge section of ice suddenly falls away from the wall revealing a massive anchor-like blade attached to a chain that swings along the <entity class="NE" id=8606>Wall</entity> , mowing through the wildlings attempting to climb its face . <entity class="NE" id=8789>Eddison</entity> notices the wildling forces are beginning to withdraw into the <entity class="NE" id=8790>Haunted Forest</entity> , proclaiming that they have stopped them for now , but that the wildlings still outnumber the black brothers 1,000 to 1 and that Mance was simply testing their defenses . Below , a heavily wounded <entity class="NE" id=8603>Tormund</entity> is surrounded in the courtyard but continues to fight despite being the only wildling alive in <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> . He is finally subdued by <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> with a crossbow and taken prisoner by the <entity class="NE" id=8600>Night's Watch</entity> for interrogation . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> returns to <entity class="NE" id=8647>Gilly</entity> just like he promised and discovers <entity class="NE" id=8703>Janos Slynt</entity> , who hid in fear during the entire battle . Against all odds , the <entity class="NE" id=8798>Night</entity> 's Watch have repelled <entity class="NE" id=8602>Mance Rayder</entity> 's forces for the time being . The following morning , what is left of <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> 's garrison begin to regroup and prepare for the inevitable next attack by <entity class="NE" id=8602>Mance Rayder</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> discusses with <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> that he has a suicidal solution to end the wildling threat ; he plans to assassinate <entity class="NE" id=8602>Mance Rayder</entity> , noting that he is the only thing binding the disparate wildling clans that make up the army , and his death will rob them of that purpose and leadership . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> tries to talk sense into <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> , but to no avail . As <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> prepares to leave via <entity class="NE" id=8601>Castle Black</entity> 's tunnel , they discover the bodies of the black brothers who held the inner gate against the giant . <entity class="NE" id=8699>Grenn</entity> is amongst the casualties and <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> that all bodies must be burned . Before <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> leaves , he remembers the promise he made to <entity class="NE" id=8813>Jeor Mormont</entity> and decides to leave <entity class="NE" id=8769>Longclaw</entity> with <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> to come back , and <entity class="NE" id=8610>Jon</entity> looks at <entity class="NE" id=8607>Sam</entity> and smiles unreassuringly before stepping out into the wilderness on the other side of the gate .
