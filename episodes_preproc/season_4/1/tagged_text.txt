<entity class="NE" id=7024>Tyrion</entity> welcomes a guest to <entity class="NE" id=7025>King</entity> 's Landing . At <entity class="NE" id=7026>Castle Black</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7027>Jon Snow</entity> finds himself unwelcome . <entity class="NE" id=7028>Dany</entity> is pointed to <entity class="NE" id=7029>Meereen</entity> , the mother of all slave cities . <entity class="NE" id=7030>Arya</entity> runs into an old friend . In <entity class="NE" id=7031>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=7032>Tywin Tywin</entity> has the ancestral <entity class="NE" id=7033>Stark Valyrian</entity> steel greatsword Ice ( held by the <entity class="NE" id=7034>Lannisters</entity> since <entity class="NE" id=7035>Eddard Stark</entity> 's execution ) melted down and re-forged into two smaller swords , after which he burns the wolf pelt scabbard the greatsword was held in . He presents one to his son Jaime as a gift . <entity class="NE" id=7036>Jaime</entity> is impressed , as the Lannisters have never previously owned a <entity class="NE" id=7037>Valyrian</entity> steel sword . <entity class="NE" id=7038>Tywin</entity> tells him he acquired the original sword from `` someone who no longer needed it '' and then commissioned a <entity class="NE" id=7039>Volantis</entity> blacksmith to re-forge it . He wants Jaime to be his heir and return home to <entity class="NE" id=7040>Casterly Rock</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=7041>Jaime</entity> insists on remaining in the <entity class="NE" id=7042>Kingsguard</entity> . Furious at <entity class="NE" id=7043>Jaime</entity> 's disobedience and lack of ambition , <entity class="NE" id=7044>Tywin</entity> rebuffs him . He tells Jaime to keep the sword anyway . <entity class="NE" id=7045>Tyrion Lannister</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7046>Bronn</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=7047>Podrick Payne</entity> wait on a road outside the city for the arrival of <entity class="NE" id=7048>Prince Prince</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=7049>Dorne</entity> , who has been invited to the royal wedding . <entity class="NE" id=7050>Tyrion</entity> quizzes <entity class="NE" id=7051>Bronn</entity> on the sigils of the <entity class="NE" id=7052>Dornish</entity> houses , none of which he knows , however <entity class="NE" id=7053>Podrick</entity> answers perfectly . <entity class="NE" id=7054>Lord Lord</entity> approaches them on horseback and says <entity class="NE" id=7055>Prince Doran</entity> is in poor health and remained at <entity class="NE" id=7056>Sunspear</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7057>Doran</entity> 's brother , <entity class="NE" id=7058>Prince Oberyn</entity> , will be attending the wedding in his stead , and arrived before dawn . Assigning the reception of the <entity class="NE" id=7059>Dornish</entity> Lords to the <entity class="NE" id=7060>City Watch</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7061>Tyrion</entity> says they should find <entity class="NE" id=7062>Oberyn</entity> as soon as possible `` before he kills somebody or several somebodies '' . <entity class="NE" id=7063>Prince Prince</entity> and his bastard paramour <entity class="NE" id=7064>Ellaria Sand</entity> are examining prostitutes in a brothel owned by <entity class="NE" id=7065>Petyr Baelish</entity> , but currently managed by <entity class="NE" id=7066>Olyvar</entity> , as <entity class="NE" id=7067>Lord Baelish</entity> is now in the <entity class="NE" id=7068>Vale</entity> . They choose the contortionist <entity class="NE" id=7069>Marei</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=7070>Oberyn</entity> orders Olyvar to get undressed also . <entity class="NE" id=7071>Oberyn</entity> is infuriated when he hears men singing The <entity class="NE" id=7072>Rains</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=7073>Castamere</entity> . He confronts the two Lannister soldiers , who insult him and <entity class="NE" id=7074>Ellaria</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7075>Oberyn</entity> moves closer and chastises them for being `` pink little men who are far too slow on the draw '' rather than being `` golden lions '' . One of the soldiers reaches for his sword , and <entity class="NE" id=7076>Oberyn</entity> quickly stabs him through the wrist with a dagger and tells the other that his friend will only live if he immediately gets help . <entity class="NE" id=7077>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7078>Bronn</entity> enter , and <entity class="NE" id=7079>Oberyn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7077>Tyrion</entity> step outside to speak privately . <entity class="NE" id=7080>Oberyn</entity> says he wants revenge for the murder of his niece <entity class="NE" id=7081>Rhaenys</entity> , his nephew <entity class="NE" id=7082>Aegon</entity> , and the rape and murder of his sister <entity class="NE" id=7083>Elia</entity> in the sack of <entity class="NE" id=7084>King</entity> 's Landing by <entity class="NE" id=7085>Lannister</entity> troops during <entity class="NE" id=7086>Robert</entity> 's Rebellion . He wants <entity class="NE" id=7087>Gregor Clegane</entity> , who murdered <entity class="NE" id=7088>Elia</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=7089>Tywin</entity> , whom <entity class="NE" id=7090>Oberyn</entity> believes gave the order for <entity class="NE" id=7088>Elia</entity> and her children to be killed . <entity class="NE" id=7091>Tyrion</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7092>Sansa</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7093>Shae</entity> , and another handmaiden are sitting in a garden . <entity class="NE" id=7094>Sansa</entity> is still distraught over the deaths of her brother and mother . <entity class="NE" id=7095>Tyrion</entity> attempts to console his wife but fails ; <entity class="NE" id=7096>Sansa</entity> has heard the gruesome details of the <entity class="NE" id=7097>Red Wedding</entity> , how the corpses of her mother and brother were desecrated . <entity class="NE" id=7098>Sansa</entity> then leaves for the godswood , not to pray but because it is the only place no one talks to her . <entity class="NE" id=7099>Tyrion</entity> returns and finds <entity class="NE" id=7100>Shae</entity> in his bed . He scolds her because no one can find out about their relationship . She attempts to seduce him but he resists . She accuses him of trying to bribe her with diamonds and ship her away to the <entity class="NE" id=7101>Free Cities</entity> , but he does n't know what she 's talking about ( <entity class="NE" id=7102>Varys</entity> did this acting alone ) . She angrily leaves the room but is spotted by the handmaiden , who is hiding behind a pillar . <entity class="NE" id=7103>Jaime</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7104>Cersei</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=7105>Qyburn</entity> are in <entity class="NE" id=7104>Cersei</entity> 's chambers . <entity class="NE" id=7106>Cersei</entity> has had a golden prosthetic hand made for <entity class="NE" id=7107>Jaime</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=7108>Qyburn</entity> attaches it to <entity class="NE" id=7107>Jaime</entity> 's stump . <entity class="NE" id=7109>Qyburn</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=7110>Cersei</entity> about her symptoms , and she says they are gone . After <entity class="NE" id=7111>Qyburn</entity> departs , <entity class="NE" id=7112>Jaime</entity> tells her that he will stay in the <entity class="NE" id=7113>Kingsguard</entity> with one hand so he can stay close to her , then tries to kiss her , but she turns away , much to <entity class="NE" id=7112>Jaime</entity> 's confusion and anger . <entity class="NE" id=7114>Cersei</entity> implies that she has taken other lovers and that their relationship has changed because of his lengthy absence , a statement that clearly wounds <entity class="NE" id=7115>Jaime</entity> . The handmaiden suddenly enters and says she has important information for <entity class="NE" id=7116>Cersei</entity> . As preparations for the royal wedding continue , <entity class="NE" id=7117>Margaery Tyrell</entity> and her grandmother Olenna are interrupted by <entity class="NE" id=7118>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=7119>Tarth</entity> , ( <entity class="NE" id=7120>Olenna</entity> being delighted to see the truth of the rumors about <entity class="NE" id=7118>Brienne</entity> ) who requests a private word with <entity class="NE" id=7121>Margaery</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7122>Brienne</entity> tells Margaery the truth of <entity class="NE" id=7123>Renly</entity> 's death and vows to one day exact revenge on <entity class="NE" id=7124>Stannis Baratheon</entity> , whom she holds responsible . They walk past a statue of King Joffrey standing over a dead direwolf , commemorating the victory over the northern rebellion . Elsewhere in the <entity class="NE" id=7125>Red Keep</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7126>Jaime</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7127>Ser Meryn Trant</entity> and King Joffrey discuss security at the upcoming wedding . <entity class="NE" id=7128>Jaime</entity> is clearly irked by <entity class="NE" id=7129>Joffrey</entity> 's arrogance as well as <entity class="NE" id=7130>Meryn</entity> 's sycophantic agreement with the king 's bragging that he is responsible for keeping the people fed ( Jaime notes that this is more the doing of the <entity class="NE" id=7131>Tyrells</entity> ) and claiming he singlehandedly won the war . <entity class="NE" id=7132>Jaime</entity> ( who had previously noted to his father that thousands in <entity class="NE" id=7133>King</entity> 's Landing alone still want <entity class="NE" id=7134>Joffrey</entity> dead ) points out that the war is far from won ; <entity class="NE" id=7135>Stannis</entity> is still alive and will probably raise fresh armies . Dismissive of the threat posed by <entity class="NE" id=7136>Stannis</entity> following the <entity class="NE" id=7137>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=7138>Blackwater</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7139>Joffrey</entity> leafs through the <entity class="NE" id=7140>Book of Brothers</entity> , which details the history of the <entity class="NE" id=7141>Kingsguard</entity> and those who served in it . He reads <entity class="NE" id=7142>Jaime</entity> 's brief entry and sneers that someone must have forgotten to record all of his uncle 's great deeds . He also questions <entity class="NE" id=7143>Jaime</entity> 's ability to serve in the <entity class="NE" id=7144>Kingsguard</entity> with one hand . Jaime defensively quips that using his left hand makes for more of a challenge . As <entity class="NE" id=7145>Sansa</entity> prays alone in the godswood , she is watched by <entity class="NE" id=7146>Jaime</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7147>Brienne</entity> ; <entity class="NE" id=7147>Brienne</entity> expects <entity class="NE" id=7146>Jaime</entity> to uphold his oath to return <entity class="NE" id=7148>Catelyn Stark</entity> 's daughters in return for his freedom , but Jaime counters by pointing out the situation is complicated by <entity class="NE" id=7149>Catelyn</entity> 's death and <entity class="NE" id=7145>Sansa</entity> 's marriage to <entity class="NE" id=7150>Tyrion</entity> . As <entity class="NE" id=7151>Sansa</entity> is leaving the godswood , she is approached by <entity class="NE" id=7152>Dontos Hollard</entity> , who thanks her for convincing <entity class="NE" id=7153>Joffrey</entity> to spare his life and gives her what he claims to be his mother 's necklace as a token of gratitude . In the <entity class="NE" id=7154>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7155>Ygritte</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7156>Tormund</entity> stand outside a stone ravine . <entity class="NE" id=7157>Tormund</entity> chides her for failing to finish off <entity class="NE" id=7158>Jon Snow</entity> . Suddenly , their scouts signal that someone is approaching . <entity class="NE" id=7159>Styr</entity> and a band of Thenn approach them through the ravine . Out of earshot , <entity class="NE" id=7160>Tormund</entity> comments about how much he hates Thenns . <entity class="NE" id=7161>Styr</entity> says his party raided a village south of the ravine and gathered meat . He says the meat tastes so much better south of the <entity class="NE" id=7162>Wall</entity> , and chides <entity class="NE" id=7163>Tormund</entity> for losing their warg as well as <entity class="NE" id=7164>Jon</entity> . He reminds <entity class="NE" id=7165>Tormund</entity> how the <entity class="NE" id=7166>Night</entity> 's Watch are feasting and getting fat at <entity class="NE" id=7167>Castle Black</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7168>Styr</entity> suggests that <entity class="NE" id=7169>Tormund</entity> taste crow meat before he dies , as a human arm roasts over a fire . At the <entity class="NE" id=7170>Wall</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=7171>Castle Black</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7172>Jon Snow</entity> has survived the injuries inflicted by <entity class="NE" id=7173>Ygritte</entity> and has largely recovered , though he still grimaces while getting dressed and walks with a slight limp . Having been told of <entity class="NE" id=7174>Robb</entity> 's death , <entity class="NE" id=7175>Jon</entity> shares with <entity class="NE" id=7176>Samwell Tarly</entity> that he had always been jealous of <entity class="NE" id=7174>Robb</entity> for having more of their father 's affection and for being better than him at riding and fighting , and with girls . Despite all this , he says he could never bring himself to hate <entity class="NE" id=7177>Robb</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7178>Sam</entity> responds by saying he has felt the same way about <entity class="NE" id=7179>Jon</entity> , that <entity class="NE" id=7179>Jon</entity> is better than him at everything ( except reading ) . It turns out that <entity class="NE" id=7180>Sam</entity> had been sent to retrieve <entity class="NE" id=7181>Jon</entity> , who has been summoned to testify before a panel of five sworn brothers , including <entity class="NE" id=7182>Maester Aemon</entity> , acting <entity class="NE" id=7183>Lord Commander Alliser Thorne</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7184>First Builder Othell Yarwyck</entity> , and the exiled former <entity class="NE" id=7185>Lord Commander</entity> of the King 's Landing City Watch , <entity class="NE" id=7186>Janos Slynt</entity> . Both Thorne and Slynt are openly hostile to <entity class="NE" id=7187>Jon</entity> , disbelieving much of what he says . At the hearing , <entity class="NE" id=7188>Jon</entity> admits to killing <entity class="NE" id=7189>Qhorin Halfhand</entity> but says that it was not murder , rather <entity class="NE" id=7190>Qhorin</entity> wanted <entity class="NE" id=7188>Jon</entity> to kill him to give <entity class="NE" id=7188>Jon</entity> credibility with the wildlings in order to get a spy into <entity class="NE" id=7191>Mance</entity> 's army . <entity class="NE" id=7192>Slynt</entity> dismisses <entity class="NE" id=7193>Jon</entity> as `` the bastard son of a traitor '' while <entity class="NE" id=7194>Thorne</entity> , a friend of <entity class="NE" id=7195>Qhorin</entity> 's , reacts with incredulity that <entity class="NE" id=7193>Jon</entity> would presume to act like he knew the <entity class="NE" id=7196>Halfhand</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7197>Jon</entity> responds by saying that <entity class="NE" id=7198>Thorne</entity> should know that <entity class="NE" id=7199>Qhorin</entity> would have done anything to protect the <entity class="NE" id=7200>Night's Watch</entity> . When <entity class="NE" id=7201>Jon</entity> refers to the wildlings as `` Free Folk , '' <entity class="NE" id=7202>Slynt</entity> accuses him of going native , to the extent he even talks like them . <entity class="NE" id=7203>Jon</entity> snaps back , acknowledging that he talks like a wildling and also admits to living amongst the wildlings , eating with them , and climbing the <entity class="NE" id=7204>Wall</entity> with them . He catches himself before admitting that he lay with one , but says it anyway . <entity class="NE" id=7205>Slynt</entity> calls for <entity class="NE" id=7206>Jon</entity> 's execution for breaking one of his vows . <entity class="NE" id=7207>Aemon</entity> points out the impracticality of executing every ranger who lays with a girl and says that `` the <entity class="NE" id=7208>Wall</entity> would be manned by headless men . '' <entity class="NE" id=7209>Thorne</entity> says that there is a difference between sneaking off to a brothel and sleeping with the enemy . <entity class="NE" id=7210>Jon</entity> does not defend himself at this point . Instead , he says that <entity class="NE" id=7211>Mance Rayder</entity> intends to attack the <entity class="NE" id=7212>Night</entity> 's Watch with his army of 100,000 wildlings and gives intelligence on <entity class="NE" id=7213>Mance</entity> 's plan of attack . Both Thorne and <entity class="NE" id=7214>Slynt</entity> disbelieve what <entity class="NE" id=7215>Jon</entity> has to say . <entity class="NE" id=7216>Aemon</entity> , however , realizes that <entity class="NE" id=7217>Jon</entity> is speaking the truth , and the hearing ends with <entity class="NE" id=7217>Jon</entity> being allowed to keep his head , although after <entity class="NE" id=7217>Jon</entity> leaves , <entity class="NE" id=7218>Thorne</entity> expresses his distrust for <entity class="NE" id=7217>Jon</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=7219>Riverlands</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7220>Arya Arya</entity> and the `` Hound '' <entity class="NE" id=7221>Sandor Clegane</entity> are still traveling through the <entity class="NE" id=7222>Riverlands</entity> on a single horse . They pass by overturned carts and dead bodies , including those of children . <entity class="NE" id=7223>Arya</entity> asks when she is going to get her own horse , complaining of the <entity class="NE" id=7224>Hound</entity> 's stench . He scoffs at the idea , noting that horses are hard to come by and that he would n't give <entity class="NE" id=7225>Arya</entity> her own horse ( even if one was available ) as she is the only thing of value he has since he did not take anything of value when he left <entity class="NE" id=7226>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=7227>Arya</entity> assures him she has no plans to run off , saying that she would die by nightfall without him as she has no one to go to . The <entity class="NE" id=7228>Hound</entity> reminds her that she still has an aunt in the <entity class="NE" id=7229>Vale</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7230>Lysa Arryn</entity> , to whom he plans to ransom <entity class="NE" id=7231>Arya</entity> . The two eventually come upon a tavern . Both hungry , <entity class="NE" id=7232>Arya</entity> suggests that they attack the men there , to which the <entity class="NE" id=7233>Hound</entity> expresses reluctance as there are five men . Just then , two men exit to relieve themselves . <entity class="NE" id=7234>Arya</entity> recognizes one of them as <entity class="NE" id=7235>Polliver</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=7236>Lannister</entity> man-at-arms who had previously taken <entity class="NE" id=7234>Arya</entity> 's sword <entity class="NE" id=7237>Needle</entity> and killed her friend <entity class="NE" id=7238>Lommy</entity> . She also notices that Polliver still has <entity class="NE" id=7239>Needle</entity> and runs off to get it back . The <entity class="NE" id=7240>Hound</entity> chases after her , stopping her at the tavern 's door , but they are seen and choose to go in anyways . It is clear that Polliver and the other men are making trouble and intend to rape the tavern owner 's daughter . <entity class="NE" id=7241>Arya</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=7242>Hound</entity> go to a table far away from everyone else , but Polliver still recognizes the <entity class="NE" id=7242>Hound</entity> and walks over to their table and strikes up a conversation . He does not recognize <entity class="NE" id=7243>Arya</entity> , who he thinks is just the <entity class="NE" id=7244>Hound</entity> 's latest sexual conquest . Polliver implies that he and his men intend to rape and pillage on their way back to <entity class="NE" id=7245>King</entity> 's Landing and invites the <entity class="NE" id=7246>Hound</entity> to come along . Polliver says that he and his men wear the King 's colors and can do whatever they like , to which the <entity class="NE" id=7247>Hound</entity> leans forward and states emphatically , `` Fuck the King . `` . The conversation then becomes tense and turns into a standoff . They eventually draw their swords . At first , the <entity class="NE" id=7248>Hound</entity> fights the five men alone while <entity class="NE" id=7249>Arya</entity> stands in the corner . He easily dispatches two of them and fights off the rest , stabbing one in the groin . Another , however , gets him on the ground , holding a dagger to his throat . The <entity class="NE" id=7250>Hound</entity> is able to fight him off , stabbing him repeatedly in the head with his own dagger . <entity class="NE" id=7251>Arya</entity> then joins the fray , smashing a pot over the head of one of the men and stabbing him with his own long sword . She then slashes <entity class="NE" id=7252>Polliver</entity> 's leg from behind , causing him to fall to the ground . <entity class="NE" id=7253>Arya</entity> takes <entity class="NE" id=7254>Needle</entity> from <entity class="NE" id=7255>Polliver</entity> and stands over his prone form . She echoes what he had said to <entity class="NE" id=7256>Lommy</entity> just before he killed him , though Polliver still does n't recognize her and has no idea what she is talking about . <entity class="NE" id=7257>Arya</entity> then repeats what he had said to her when he took <entity class="NE" id=7258>Needle</entity> : `` Fine little blade . Maybe I 'll pick my teeth with it . '' It is at that point when <entity class="NE" id=7259>Polliver</entity> recognizes her and becomes frightened . <entity class="NE" id=7260>Arya</entity> then kills Polliver in the same way he had killed <entity class="NE" id=7261>Lommy</entity> by driving <entity class="NE" id=7262>Needle</entity> slowly into his throat . <entity class="NE" id=7263>Arya</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=7264>Hound</entity> then leave the tavern , taking with them a horse for <entity class="NE" id=7263>Arya</entity> and a chicken the <entity class="NE" id=7264>Hound</entity> wanted . Across the <entity class="NE" id=7265>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=7266>Daenerys Daenerys</entity> sits near the sea with her three dragons , each one about the size of a small horse . <entity class="NE" id=7267>Daenerys</entity> strokes <entity class="NE" id=7268>Drogon</entity> 's head , while <entity class="NE" id=7269>Rhaegal</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7270>Viserion</entity> fight over a dead lamb , <entity class="NE" id=7268>Drogon</entity> joins the fight . As <entity class="NE" id=7271>Daenerys</entity> tries to calm him down , without warning , <entity class="NE" id=7272>Drogon</entity> snaps at her with a hiss , a warning to not interfere . He then roars and goes to contest the kill . <entity class="NE" id=7273>Drogon</entity> snarls a warning at his mother . This act , that her own children would threaten her , and that they are outgrowing her influence and ability to rein them , leaves <entity class="NE" id=7274>Daenerys</entity> visibly shaken . <entity class="NE" id=7275>Jorah Mormont</entity> approaches and tells her that dragons can never be tamed , not even by their mother . <entity class="NE" id=7276>Daenerys</entity> returns to her Unsullied army to resume the march to <entity class="NE" id=7277>Meereen</entity> . She notices <entity class="NE" id=7278>Grey Worm</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7279>Daario Naharis</entity> are absent and sets out to find them after being told they are `` gambling '' . She finds the two men sitting face-to-face holding their swords in front of them ; they have been contesting their strength since midnight . <entity class="NE" id=7280>Daario</entity> explains they are deciding on which of them will ride up front with her in the vanguard . Frustrated , <entity class="NE" id=7281>Daenerys</entity> states that the honor goes to <entity class="NE" id=7282>Ser Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=7283>Ser Barristan</entity> as they did not keep her waiting all morning . She orders the two men to ride at the back with the livestock . <entity class="NE" id=7284>Daenerys</entity> also adds that the last man holding his sword shall find a new queen to fight for and both men immediately drop their weapons . On the road to <entity class="NE" id=7285>Meereen</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=7286>Daenerys</entity> speaks with <entity class="NE" id=7287>Missandei</entity> , who tells her queen that <entity class="NE" id=7285>Meereen</entity> would be wise to fear her approach . <entity class="NE" id=7288>Daario</entity> meets them on the cliff side , and <entity class="NE" id=7289>Daenerys</entity> expresses her annoyance when he shows her flowers he has picked .
