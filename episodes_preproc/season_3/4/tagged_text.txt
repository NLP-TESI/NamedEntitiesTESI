The <entity class="NE" id=4749>Night's Watch</entity> takes stock ; <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> meets his better ; <entity class="NE" id=4751>Arya</entity> is taken to the commander of the <entity class="NE" id=4752>Brotherhood</entity> ; <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> makes an exchange . In the <entity class="NE" id=4754>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=4755>Riverlands</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4756>Jaime Lannister</entity> has had his sword-hand cut off by <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> . The following day , <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> 's men lead their prisoners Jaime and <entity class="NE" id=4759>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4760>Tarth</entity> back to <entity class="NE" id=4761>Harrenhal</entity> on horseback . <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> is gaining maximum enjoyment from torturing someone who ca n't possibly fight back : he ties <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> 's severed right hand onto a rope and hangs it around <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> 's neck , forcing <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> to smell as the flesh of his own hand rots . <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> is physically in agony from his wound , feverish and half-delirious . <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> can barely stay conscious , and he falls headlong off of his horse into the mud . <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> has been tormenting Jaime by not giving him water and he is almost dying of thirst . One of <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> 's men moves to give him water but instead empties the canteen over <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> 's head to taunt him . Jaime weakly tries to point out that if he actually dies <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> and his men will be in serious trouble , but <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> simply dismisses this . <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> then hands him a container , which he desperately guzzles down rapidly , too weak to notice what it is . <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> then points out that he filled the container with horse piss just to torment Jaime , who spits out what he can . <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> can barely move , but <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> viciously kicks him repeatedly . In a surge of effort Jaime manages to steal the sword from one of <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> 's men , but <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> is so weak and feverish that he can barely stand , much less wield a sword - and he can not fight as well with his left hand as he could his sword-hand . Jaime soon realizes this , and actually is n't trying to fight them off any more , but instead to provoke one of them to kill him so he does n't have to go on living like this and can die with the small dignity of having a sword in his hand . He succumbs to exhaustion and <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> does n't even bother to punish him this time , just warning him that if he tries that again he 'll cut off his other hand . Later that night Jaime and <entity class="NE" id=4759>Brienne</entity> are restrained near a campfire . <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> refuses to eat , and says he wants to die . <entity class="NE" id=4759>Brienne</entity> says he should try to live for revenge , but <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> says he was that hand , and without his sword-hand , even if he escapes , he is nothing , and would rather die as the Jaime he was than go on living , robbed of his very identity . <entity class="NE" id=4759>Brienne</entity> grows angry , insinuating to Jaime that this is the first time he 's had to face the real world where things people care about get taken away , but he 's pathetically moping around like a woman . Her criticism and strength convinces Jaime to start eating . <entity class="NE" id=4759>Brienne</entity> says she overheard when he earlier managed to talk <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> out of letting his men gang-rape her , by convincing him that her father will pay <entity class="NE" id=4757>Locke</entity> her weight in sapphires . While <entity class="NE" id=4759>Brienne</entity> is a noblewoman and worth a ransom , <entity class="NE" id=4760>Tarth</entity> is called `` the <entity class="NE" id=4786>Sapphire Isle</entity> '' due to the color of the seas around it , not because there are any actual sapphires , and <entity class="HSE" id=4787>House Tarth</entity> is not particularly rich . <entity class="NE" id=4759>Brienne</entity> is completely confused , and asks Jaime why he helped her , but he does n't answer . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> ' long awaited revenge . In <entity class="NE" id=4790>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=4791>Tyrion Lannister</entity> meets with <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> , who is in the middle of prying open a large wooden crate . <entity class="NE" id=4793>Tyrion</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> to help him confirm who sent <entity class="NE" id=4795>Ser Mandon Moore</entity> to kill him during the <entity class="NE" id=4796>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4797>Blackwater</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> says he would like to help , but the most he has are whispers that it was <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> , but only whispers , and he can not confirm who gave the order . <entity class="NE" id=4793>Tyrion</entity> wants to know with certainty if it was his sister so he can take revenge . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> uses this opportunity to finish a conversation they were having on the eve of the battle , in which <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> promised to reveal how he was castrated . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> says that he used to be a slave in a travelling troupe that passed through all of the <entity class="NE" id=4803>Free Cities</entity> , but once when he was in Myr he was sold to a sorcerer . The sorcerer gave him a potion which temporarily paralyzed him while still leaving him fully aware and able to experience pain , and then he cut his genitals off , root and stem ( shaft and testes ) . The sorcerer needed his genitals as a sacrifice for a spell , and he burned <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> ' genitals in a brazier of fire . What <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> has had recurrent nightmares about to this day is not the sorcerer , or the knife , or the pain . but that when the sorcerer prayed to the blue flames in his ceremony , a voice clearly answered him from the flames . Whether it was a god or a demon or simply parlor tricks , <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> never knew , as the sorcerer threw him out into the street to die . But he was determined to live , to spite the sorcerer , and one day get his revenge on him . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> did whatever it took to claw his way up into a position of influence in the world : first , to survive he would beg , steal , or sell the sexual use of the parts of his body he still had . Increasingly , he discovered that stealing men 's secrets was far more profitable than anything physical which could be stolen , and in time , he worked his way up from the slums of <entity class="NE" id=4808>Myr</entity> to the <entity class="NE" id=4809>Small Council</entity> in <entity class="NE" id=4790>King</entity> 's Landing . This is why <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> has always hated those who claim to wield magical powers , and particularly why he opposed <entity class="NE" id=4812>Stannis Baratheon</entity> , who relies on the <entity class="NE" id=4813>Red Priestess Melisandre</entity> . As <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> finishes his long tale , he finally finishes prying the last nail out of the crate and opens it . To <entity class="NE" id=4793>Tyrion</entity> 's astonishment , it contains an elderly sorcerer , the very same one that castrated <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> so many years ago . He is still alive but gagged , and was shipped to Varys in the crate . Using his own life as an example , <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> thus urges <entity class="NE" id=4793>Tyrion</entity> to be patient , and his revenge will come to him in time . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> then closes the crate , with the sorcerer still inside . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> visits <entity class="NE" id=4821>Ros</entity> , who has been secretly spying on Littlefinger for him . He is surprised to hear her report from the other prostitutes in the brothel on the prodigious activities of one <entity class="NE" id=4822>Podrick Payne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> is perplexed as to what exactly happened ; <entity class="NE" id=4821>Ros</entity> says the girls told her he was n't particularly large or anything , so much as what he did , but when she repeatedly asked them what exactly that was , the most they could say is that it was `` hard to describe . '' She then reports on how frequently <entity class="NE" id=4825>Littlefinger</entity> has visited <entity class="NE" id=4826>Sansa Stark</entity> , and says she thinks he is obsessed with her , and wants to smuggle her out of the city . He asks why she thinks this is true , and she presents a stolen copy of the ship 's manifest for the boat that will take Littlefinger to the <entity class="NE" id=4827>Vale</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> is surprised that <entity class="NE" id=4821>Ros</entity> is literate and asks what obvious point it is that he does n't see . She points out that there will be two feather beds , and <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> realizes <entity class="NE" id=4825>Littlefinger</entity> would only pay the extra money for someone other than Littlefinger if it was <entity class="NE" id=4832>Sansa</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=4835>Great Sept</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4836>Baelor</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4837>Joffrey</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4838>Margaery</entity> wave at the pleased crowd . <entity class="NE" id=4837>Joffrey</entity> gives <entity class="NE" id=4838>Margaery</entity> a tour of the <entity class="NE" id=4835>Great Sept</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4836>Baelor</entity> , where their royal wedding is to be held , as <entity class="NE" id=4843>Cersei Lannister</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4844>Olenna Tyrell</entity> follow . <entity class="NE" id=4837>Joffrey</entity> excitedly relates tales of the darker chapters of the <entity class="NE" id=4835>Great Sept</entity> 's history , to <entity class="NE" id=4838>Margaery</entity> 's feigned interest and <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> 's annoyance . <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> asks if <entity class="NE" id=4850>Robert Baratheon</entity> was buried with the <entity class="NE" id=4851>Targaryen</entity> kings in the <entity class="NE" id=4835>Great Sept</entity> ; <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> explains that he left instructions to return his remains to <entity class="NE" id=4854>Storm</entity> 's End . When <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> dismisses the accident that claimed <entity class="NE" id=4856>Robert</entity> 's life , <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> laments her son 's total lack of military prowess . <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> points out that <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> 's son <entity class="NE" id=4860>Lord Mace Tyrell</entity> besieged <entity class="NE" id=4854>Storm</entity> 's End for almost a full year during <entity class="NE" id=4856>Robert</entity> 's Rebellion , but <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> scoffs that her oaf of a son is no warrior and the only thing he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent . <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> muses on the shortcomings of the men in their lives and the arrangement of patriarchy in general , to which <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> wistfully says that it is the will of the gods . Thus distracted , <entity class="NE" id=4838>Margaery</entity> convinces <entity class="NE" id=4837>Joffrey</entity> to greet the crowd outside . Having been somewhat placated by <entity class="NE" id=4838>Margaery</entity> 's charity , the crowd happily cheers for the pair of them . <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> realizes she has lost control of <entity class="NE" id=4837>Joffrey</entity> to the <entity class="NE" id=4870>Tyrells</entity> . Subsequently , <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> meets with her father Tywin in his chambers . She wants to ensure that he is doing everything he can to find <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4873>Tywin</entity> dismissively points out that he started a war when his hated dwarf son <entity class="NE" id=4793>Tyrion</entity> was captured by the <entity class="NE" id=4875>Starks</entity> , so assuredly he is willing to do even more now for his elder son . <entity class="NE" id=4873>Tywin</entity> makes it clear that he considers Jaime his heir - despite the fact that as a <entity class="NE" id=4877>Kingsguard</entity> member , <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> has officially renounced all rights to inheritance . <entity class="NE" id=4793>Tyrion</entity> previously noted that he is next in line of succession after <entity class="NE" id=4763>Jaime</entity> , as a younger son inherits before an older daughter , but <entity class="NE" id=4873>Tywin</entity> said he would never let his hated dwarf son be his heir . <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> points out that ( as she is next in line of succession ) maybe <entity class="NE" id=4873>Tywin</entity> should consider her the real heir to his legacy , not his sons . She claims she is the only one of his children who ever took his lectures on family and legacy seriously . She points out that for a man who pays a lot of lip service to `` family '' and `` legacy , '' he excludes her from his plans . <entity class="NE" id=4873>Tywin</entity> confirms that he excludes <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> from his plans , but not because she is a woman : he distrusts her because she is n't nearly as smart as she thinks she is . He sneers that she has allowed <entity class="NE" id=4837>Joffrey</entity> to run roughshod over her , the city and its people , and that he intends to rein in his grandson 's deranged behavior . <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> says she is afraid of the growing influence of the <entity class="NE" id=4870>Tyrells</entity> at court , and something must be done about them . In particular , <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> is nervous about how skilled <entity class="NE" id=4890>Margaery Tyrell</entity> is at manipulating <entity class="NE" id=4837>Joffrey</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4873>Tywin</entity> bluntly responds that it 's good someone has finally been able to manipulate <entity class="NE" id=4837>Joffrey</entity> , as <entity class="NE" id=4799>Cersei</entity> herself has clearly proven to be incapable of doing it . She says <entity class="NE" id=4873>Tywin</entity> should try stopping <entity class="NE" id=4837>Joffrey</entity> from doing what he likes ( implying he will find it extremely difficult ) , but her father firmly responds , `` I will . `` . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> discuss <entity class="NE" id=4832>Sansa</entity> Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> is seated in the gardens with two of <entity class="NE" id=4838>Margaery</entity> 's cousins . One of them embroiders a golden <entity class="NE" id=4901>Tyrell</entity> rose with their motto , `` Growing <entity class="NE" id=4902>Strong</entity> , '' which prompts <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> to complain that their family has the dullest sigil and motto in the <entity class="NE" id=4754>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . Other families have interesting mottos like `` Winter is Coming '' or `` We Do Not <entity class="NE" id=4905>Sow</entity> , '' and have direwolves and krakens for sigils . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> arrives to meet with <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> and she shoos the girls away . They walk through the gardens , and while <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> remains relatively polite she instantly sees through all of <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> ' pleasantries . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> is verbally outmatched , for once , and she asks him to just get to the point . He says that he is extremely worried that <entity class="NE" id=4825>Littlefinger</entity> is going to try to take control of <entity class="NE" id=4826>Sansa Stark</entity> : with <entity class="NE" id=4913>Robb Stark</entity> 's younger brothers presumed dead at <entity class="NE" id=4914>Winterfell</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=4915>Arya Stark</entity> missing and presumed dead for over a year , <entity class="NE" id=4832>Sansa</entity> is <entity class="NE" id=4917>Robb</entity> 's only heir . The War of the <entity class="NE" id=4918>Five Kings</entity> is not going well for the <entity class="NE" id=4875>Starks</entity> now , and if <entity class="NE" id=4917>Robb</entity> were to be defeated and die , the man who controls <entity class="NE" id=4832>Sansa</entity> controls the <entity class="NE" id=4922>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4750>Varys</entity> says that while he enjoys sparring with <entity class="NE" id=4924>Baelish</entity> , he is truly horrified by the man . While they are all engaged in the intrigues and murders of court politics , <entity class="NE" id=4924>Baelish</entity> has utterly no limits on what he will do to achieve power : he would burn the entire realm down if it meant he could be king of the ashes . <entity class="NE" id=4834>Olenna</entity> agrees and says that the solution is rather obvious . Shortly thereafter , <entity class="NE" id=4890>Margaery Tyrell</entity> finds <entity class="NE" id=4826>Sansa Stark</entity> praying in the <entity class="NE" id=4929>Red Keep</entity> 's godswood , overlooking <entity class="NE" id=4930>Blackwater Bay</entity> . She dismisses the Lannister guards ( threatening to tell the king they refused her if they do n't leave ) and engages in pleasant small-talk . <entity class="NE" id=4838>Margaery</entity> plays a small joke on <entity class="NE" id=4832>Sansa</entity> by saying that her cousin died of a pox which made her face melt off , but is just trying to brighten her spirits ( though in the process is reminded that <entity class="NE" id=4832>Sansa</entity> is still somewhat naïve ) . <entity class="NE" id=4838>Margaery</entity> then invites <entity class="NE" id=4832>Sansa</entity> to visit <entity class="NE" id=4935>Highgarden</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=4936>Reach</entity> someday . <entity class="NE" id=4832>Sansa</entity> is confused , as <entity class="NE" id=4938>Queen Cersei</entity> wo n't allow her to leave the city , but <entity class="NE" id=4838>Margaery</entity> wryly points out that <entity class="NE" id=4940>Queen Regent Cersei</entity> might not want her to , but <entity class="NE" id=4941>Queen Margaery</entity> would be happy to share <entity class="NE" id=4935>Highgarden</entity> 's pageantry with a friend . or a sister . <entity class="NE" id=4838>Margaery</entity> points out that if <entity class="NE" id=4832>Sansa</entity> were to marry <entity class="NE" id=4945>Loras</entity> , then she would belong in <entity class="NE" id=4935>Highgarden</entity> anyway . The thought of finally escaping <entity class="NE" id=4837>Joffrey</entity> , being wed to her idol and becoming a <entity class="NE" id=4901>Tyrell</entity> makes <entity class="NE" id=4832>Sansa</entity> choke out tears of joy . The <entity class="NE" id=4950>Hound</entity> is brought before the <entity class="NE" id=4752>Brotherhood</entity> to answer for his crimes . Elsewhere in the <entity class="NE" id=4755>Riverlands</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4915>Arya Stark</entity> and Gendry are kept hooded as <entity class="NE" id=4954>Thoros</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4808>Myr</entity> and his men lead them into a cave , <entity class="NE" id=4956>Hollow Hill</entity> , which serves as the secret hideout of the <entity class="NE" id=4957>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4958>Sandor</entity> `` The <entity class="NE" id=4950>Hound</entity> '' <entity class="NE" id=4960>Clegane</entity> is brought with them in restraints , and is confronted by the leader of the <entity class="NE" id=4752>Brotherhood</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4962>Ser Beric Dondarrion</entity> . Ser Ser was commanded by none other than <entity class="NE" id=4963>Eddard Stark</entity> to lead a group of soldiers to track down and bring to justice the false knight <entity class="NE" id=4964>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> , when he started raiding the <entity class="NE" id=4755>Riverlands</entity> under <entity class="NE" id=4966>Tywin Lannister</entity> 's orders at the very beginning of the War of the <entity class="NE" id=4918>Five Kings</entity> . They subsequently became trapped behind Lannister lines , but continued to harass their forces by forming the <entity class="NE" id=4752>Brotherhood</entity> . Over time , however , they began to realize how much suffering was being inflicted on the smallfolk of the Riverlands by <entity class="NE" id=4969>Stark</entity> and Lannister forces alike , and began to defend the commoners from raiders from both sides of the war . Over time they were joined by <entity class="NE" id=4969>Stark</entity> deserters , <entity class="NE" id=4971>Baratheon</entity> deserters , and commoners who want to defend their homes . <entity class="NE" id=4972>Dondarrion</entity> says he 's still following the mission that <entity class="NE" id=4963>Eddard Stark</entity> set him on , to bring <entity class="NE" id=4974>Gregor Clegane</entity> to justice and restore King <entity class="NE" id=4856>Robert</entity> 's peace to the <entity class="NE" id=4755>Riverlands</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=4950>Hound</entity> balks that <entity class="NE" id=4978>Eddard</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4856>Robert</entity> are dead now , and he ca n't just be fighting for ghosts , but <entity class="NE" id=4972>Dondarrion</entity> says that now the <entity class="NE" id=4752>Brotherhood</entity> are ghosts , attacking the <entity class="NE" id=4982>Lannisters</entity> where they least expect them , melting away back to their hideouts in the woods . The <entity class="NE" id=4752>Brotherhood</entity> points out that the Lannister `` lions '' have been butchering the innocent . At the outbreak of the war , <entity class="NE" id=4972>Dondarrion</entity> 's group were ambushed in the <entity class="NE" id=4796>Battle</entity> at the <entity class="NE" id=4986>Mummer</entity> 's Ford , where girls as young as seven were raped and babies were cut in half in front of their parents . <entity class="NE" id=4958>Sandor</entity> points out that he was n't at <entity class="NE" id=4986>Mummer</entity> 's Ford . The <entity class="NE" id=4752>Brotherhood</entity> continues to cite various Lannister crimes : <entity class="NE" id=4954>Thoros</entity> says he was there during the Sack of <entity class="NE" id=4790>King</entity> 's Landing and saw the butchered corpses of the royal children , <entity class="NE" id=4992>Rhaenys</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4993>Aegon Targaryen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4958>Sandor</entity> continues to point out that he was n't present for these crimes and many of them were in fact committed by his older brother <entity class="NE" id=4995>Gregor</entity> ( who personally killed the baby <entity class="NE" id=4996>Aegon</entity> , then raped and killed his mother <entity class="NE" id=4997>Elia</entity> ) . <entity class="NE" id=4958>Sandor</entity> says that they ca n't kill him for the crime of being born into <entity class="HSE" id=4999>House Clegane</entity> and being related to <entity class="NE" id=4995>Gregor</entity> . He also scoffs at how <entity class="NE" id=4972>Dondarrion</entity> and many of his men have converted to the <entity class="NE" id=5002>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5003>Light</entity> religion , of which <entity class="NE" id=4954>Thoros</entity> is a priest . <entity class="NE" id=4751>Arya</entity> then speaks up , and angrily accuses <entity class="NE" id=4958>Sandor</entity> of killing her friend <entity class="NE" id=5007>Mycah</entity> , the butcher 's boy , then slinging his corpse over his horse like a deer . <entity class="NE" id=4958>Sandor</entity> matter-of-factly admits that he killed <entity class="NE" id=5007>Mycah</entity> , but says he was in no place to question then-Prince <entity class="NE" id=4837>Joffrey</entity> 's orders . The <entity class="NE" id=4752>Brotherhood</entity> , closing in on something <entity class="NE" id=4958>Sandor</entity> actually did , charge him with the crime of following orders to kill <entity class="NE" id=5007>Mycah</entity> , but that they will give him a fair trial : Dondarrion himself will face <entity class="NE" id=4958>Sandor</entity> in a trial by combat . In the <entity class="NE" id=4922>North</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5015>Bran Stark</entity> is having a shared greensight dream with <entity class="NE" id=5016>Jojen Reed</entity> . They are walking through the woods and see the three-eyed raven again . <entity class="NE" id=5017>Jojen</entity> advises <entity class="NE" id=5018>Bran</entity> that he must follow the raven , and when he is confused , <entity class="NE" id=5017>Jojen</entity> points out that he must follow it by climbing a tree . <entity class="NE" id=5018>Bran</entity> begins to climb the tree that the raven has landed in but he soon becomes terrified , remembering the fall that crippled him when he was climbing a tower at <entity class="NE" id=4914>Winterfell</entity> . He sees a vivid dream-memory of his mother <entity class="NE" id=5021>Catelyn</entity> , repeating her warning in which she made him promise never to climb again - a promise which he broke , and thus indirectly led to the fall which crippled him . <entity class="NE" id=5018>Bran</entity> is so terrified of the memory of <entity class="NE" id=5021>Catelyn</entity> yelling at him that he falls off the tree . <entity class="NE" id=5018>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5017>Jojen</entity> wake in their camp in the woods , disappointed that he could not follow the three-eyed raven . Elsewhere , apparently in the <entity class="NE" id=4922>North</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5027>Theon Greyjoy</entity> is being led by the boy who set him free from the dungeon and then rescued him by killing his captors when they tried to recapture him . He says that he is leading Theon to <entity class="NE" id=5028>Deepwood Motte</entity> , a castle on the west coast of the <entity class="NE" id=4922>North</entity> which was captured by his sister <entity class="NE" id=5030>Yara</entity> . He says he is concerned that some of the guards may betray Theon , so it is best to sneak into the castle through the drains until they reach his sister in person . As the boy fumbles around with keys at a locked gate , <entity class="NE" id=5031>Theon</entity> sinks to the ground and asks if his father <entity class="NE" id=5032>Balon</entity> knows he was taken captive ; the boy says he does n't know but <entity class="NE" id=5031>Theon</entity> says he probably did but left him for dead . Filled with remorse , <entity class="NE" id=5031>Theon</entity> laments that his real father died when his head was cut off in <entity class="NE" id=4790>King</entity> 's Landing , that he had a choice between two families , and he chose wrong . <entity class="NE" id=5031>Theon</entity> says that now , he has destroyed everything he ever cared about , and his real home <entity class="NE" id=4914>Winterfell</entity> is burned to the ground . He also says the only thing he ever resented about <entity class="NE" id=4913>Robb Stark</entity> is that <entity class="NE" id=4917>Robb</entity> could effortlessly be the kind of good man that Theon truly wanted to be but had to struggle against his own failings to be like . Theon even apologizes aloud for having two innocent orphan boys killed , so in desperation he could pass them off as <entity class="NE" id=5018>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5040>Rickon Stark</entity> . The boy is surprised , and Theon explains to him that <entity class="NE" id=5018>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5042>Rickon</entity> escaped , so he had to fake their deaths so he would n't seem weak . The boy leads Theon into a dark chamber in the castle , and he calls out for <entity class="NE" id=5030>Yara</entity> . The boy then lights a torch . revealing the same X-shaped cross that <entity class="NE" id=5031>Theon</entity> was chained to when he was being tortured before . <entity class="NE" id=5031>Theon</entity> was led in a complete circle , back to the very same dungeon he `` escaped '' from in the first place . Other guards come in and the boy shouts to tie Theon up again , where he belongs , and that it was Theon who killed the other guards when he tried to escape ( instead of him ) . The boy , giving commands , is revealed to be one of the head torturers , and <entity class="NE" id=5031>Theon</entity> 's entire `` escape '' that he led him on was nothing more than another form of torture , sadistically toying with him . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=5047>Wall</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> 's Keep , tensions run high among the members of the <entity class="NE" id=5049>Night</entity> 's Watch who sought shelter there after escaping the devastating defeat at the <entity class="NE" id=4796>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=5051>Fist</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=5052>First Men</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5053>Grenn</entity> and Edd are shoveling pig-shit , but the former rapist <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> urges them that they are not safe here and can not trust <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> : the man sacrifices his own newborn sons to the <entity class="NE" id=5056>White Walkers</entity> , and there 's every probability that if the <entity class="NE" id=5057>White</entity> Walkers do come , he 'll hand over the <entity class="NE" id=4749>Night's Watch</entity> survivors to his real masters . <entity class="NE" id=5053>Grenn</entity> and Edd do n't want to discuss it . <entity class="NE" id=5060>Samwell Tarly</entity> visits <entity class="NE" id=5061>Gilly</entity> , who is deeply distraught about the fate of her newborn son . She is frantic , and yells at <entity class="NE" id=5062>Sam</entity> not to draw attention to the fact that it 's a boy by calling it a `` he '' so loud , as <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> will want to offer it up as a sacrifice when he finds out it 's a son . He asks her if she 's decided on a name , but she responds that there 's no point in naming her baby if he 's only going to be offered up as a human sacrifice . She gives <entity class="NE" id=5062>Sam</entity> back his mother 's thimble and says she does n't care about such stupid things , all she 's focused on is protecting the life of her baby . Some of their wounded have died from their injuries , and <entity class="NE" id=5065>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entity> leads a funeral service as they burn the corpse of a man named <entity class="NE" id=5066>Bannen</entity> on a pyre . <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> did n't know the man well , but he rode bravely into the unknown lands far beyond the <entity class="NE" id=5047>Wall</entity> , fought valiantly at the <entity class="NE" id=5051>Fist</entity> against monsters which they did n't even know existed , and they will never see a man that brave again . He closes the eulogy with the traditional closing line for members of the <entity class="NE" id=4749>Night's Watch</entity> , `` And now , his watch is ended , '' which the assembled men repeat . In the main hall , <entity class="NE" id=5071>Lord Commander Mormont</entity> is checking a map in his journal , as <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> continues to crassly berate the men of the <entity class="NE" id=4749>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> says that they have to stay long enough for their wounded to recover sufficiently to be fit to travel , but <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> waves this off , saying they 've recovered as much as they ever will . <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> openly suggests that they should just kill the men who are so severely wounded that they wo n't be able to travel , and if <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> is reluctant to do the deed himself , he can just leave and <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> will finish them off . <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> declines . Another young <entity class="NE" id=4749>Night's Watch</entity> man , <entity class="NE" id=5080>Karl Tanner</entity> , comes in to complain that Craster is feeding them nothing but bread cut with sawdust , and he wants to know where <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> keeps his hidden larder . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> is sitting there getting quite drunk on the wine they gifted to him when they first came . <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> joins in the accusations , and <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> admits that he has winter stockpiles , but he needs those to feed his women and refuses to share them . <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> calls Craster a bastard - at which <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> becomes enraged and threatens <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> with an axe . <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> restrains <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> shouts that he 's throwing them all out to lie down outside in the cold on their empty bellies . <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> says he will chop the hands off the next man who calls him `` bastard . '' A tense moment of silence passes , and <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> grabs <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> to lead him out the doorway . <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> is murdered . .when <entity class="NE" id=5094>Karl</entity> , firmly staring directly at <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> , challenges him and calls him a `` daughter-fucking , wildling bastard , '' <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> lunges forward at <entity class="NE" id=5094>Karl</entity> in a blind rage , but he is drunk and clumsy : without flinching , <entity class="NE" id=5094>Karl</entity> holds off <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> 's axe with his left hand , while using his right hand to ram a dagger through the old man 's throat , which goes up into the roof of his mouth . He flings the dying <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> to the ground , then punches one of <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> 's wives who is present , demanding to know where the hidden food is kept . <entity class="NE" id=5097>Lord Lord</entity> bellows that the gods will curse him for this , as a guest killing a host who has formally accepted him into his home breaks all the laws of gods and men . <entity class="NE" id=5094>Karl</entity> shouts that there are no laws beyond the <entity class="NE" id=5047>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5094>Karl</entity> continues to threaten the girl with a knife , so <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> draws his sword , which makes <entity class="NE" id=5094>Karl</entity> drop the girl and begin to face off against <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> with his dagger . Suddenly , <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> comes up behind <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> and literally stabs the <entity class="NE" id=5104>Lord Commander</entity> in the back , which makes <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> drop his sword . For a brief moment the men stare in shock , then <entity class="NE" id=5053>Grenn</entity> charges and tackles <entity class="NE" id=5094>Karl</entity> . The entire room explodes into pure bedlam . The desperate <entity class="NE" id=5049>Night</entity> 's Watch recruits like <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> , mostly conscripted criminals exiled to the <entity class="NE" id=5047>Wall</entity> , turn on officers who are loyal to <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> , as well as some of the other common recruits like <entity class="NE" id=5053>Grenn</entity> who stay loyal . <entity class="NE" id=5112>Quick</entity> flashes of the fight go by as no one can really perceive what 's happening , and the mutiny spreads throughout <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> 's Keep . In the midst of it , <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> turns around to fight off Rast . <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> may have a knife in his back but he is twice <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> 's size and completely enraged . <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> grabs Rast by the throat and lifts him off his feet , one-handed , then spins him around and hurls him against the opposite wall . Still choking <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> nearly succeeds in crushing <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> 's windpipe with his bare hand - but then <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> starts to cough up thick red blood . His knife wound is mortal . The injured Mormont then sinks to the ground and continues to cough up blood . Now that Mormont is on the ground unarmed and helpless , <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> grabs a knife and repeatedly pounds it into <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> 's throat until the <entity class="NE" id=5122>Old Bear</entity> is dead . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=5062>Sam</entity> rushes to <entity class="NE" id=5061>Gilly</entity> 's hut and orders her that they have to escape now or they never will . <entity class="NE" id=5062>Sam</entity> runs out of <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> 's Keep with <entity class="NE" id=5061>Gilly</entity> and her baby , as loyal <entity class="NE" id=4749>Night's Watch</entity> members fall to the mutineers , who also kill or rape <entity class="NE" id=5048>Craster</entity> 's other wives . Gilly leads the way into the night because she knows the woods around her home . Covered in <entity class="NE" id=5067>Mormont</entity> 's blood , <entity class="NE" id=5054>Rast</entity> shouts into the darkness that `` Piggy '' can run for now , but he 'll soon be cutting <entity class="NE" id=5062>Sam</entity> 's throat too . Across the <entity class="NE" id=5132>Narrow Sea</entity> . At the city of <entity class="NE" id=5133>Astapor</entity> in <entity class="NE" id=5134>Slaver</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=5135>Bay</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5136>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> arrives before <entity class="NE" id=5137>Kraznys</entity> mo <entity class="NE" id=5138>Nakloz</entity> and the other slave-masters of the city , with her Dothraki guards carrying the largest of her dragons , <entity class="NE" id=5139>Drogon</entity> , in its large cage . <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> is accompanied by her <entity class="NE" id=5141>Queensgard</entity> members , <entity class="NE" id=5142>Ser Jorah Mormont</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5143>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> . Missandei the translator , gifted to Daenerys at her request , is now dressed in higher-quality clothing which matches <entity class="NE" id=5144>Dany</entity> 's style of dress . All eight thousand of the <entity class="NE" id=5145>Unsullied</entity> warrior-eunuchs are gathered in the city 's main square for the transaction . The other upper-class men and women of <entity class="NE" id=5133>Astapor</entity> crowd around the square , gawking at the dragon while slaves in heavy chains serve them refreshments . <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> reveals <entity class="NE" id=5139>Drogon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5137>Kraznys</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> , via <entity class="NE" id=5151>Missandei</entity> 's interpretation in the <entity class="NE" id=5152>Low Valyrian</entity> language , that many of the Unsullied have not yet seen battle , so she would do well to attack some minor cities and towns here and there on her way to <entity class="NE" id=5153>Westeros</entity> . The slavers will happily purchase any slaves she captures , so it 's a win-win situation . He also wryly notes that any young boys she sells as slaves will be castrated and ready to serve as new Unsullied when their training is over in about ten years ' time . <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> lets her dragon out of its cage , and leads it on a long chain leash attached to its foot as it hovers about twenty feet in the air . She hands the leash to <entity class="NE" id=5137>Kraznys</entity> , and in return he gives her a cat-o-nine-tails with a hilt shaped like a <entity class="NE" id=5156>Harpy</entity> , signifying ownership of the <entity class="NE" id=5145>Unsullied</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> asks if it is done , and <entity class="NE" id=5137>Kraznys</entity> impatiently says that it is , as he struggles to rein in the dragon . To the surprise of <entity class="NE" id=5151>Missandei</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> calls the <entity class="NE" id=5145>Unsullied</entity> to attention in <entity class="NE" id=5163>Valyrian</entity> , and proceeds to test them with basic <entity class="NE" id=5163>Valyrian</entity> marching commands . She smiles slightly , knowing they are now hers . Too distracted to notice , <entity class="NE" id=5137>Kraznys</entity> complains for <entity class="NE" id=5151>Missandei</entity> to tell `` the bitch '' that the dragon wo n't come when he commands . <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> turns to face <entity class="NE" id=5137>Kraznys</entity> and bluntly says `` A dragon is not a slave , '' again in perfectly-accented <entity class="NE" id=5163>Valyrian</entity> . When a dumbfounded <entity class="NE" id=5137>Kraznys</entity> demands an explanation , she declares that she is <entity class="NE" id=5170>Daenerys Stormborn</entity> of <entity class="HSE" id=5171>House Targaryen</entity> , of the blood of <entity class="NE" id=5172>Old Valyria</entity> : <entity class="NE" id=5163>Valyrian</entity> is her mother-tongue indicating she 'd been feigning ignorance the entire time ( and putting up with <entity class="NE" id=5137>Kraznys</entity> ' insulting comments ) to lull them into a false sense of security . <entity class="NE" id=5139>Drogon</entity> burns Kraznys The <entity class="NE" id=5145>Unsullied</entity> sack <entity class="NE" id=5133>Astapor</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> then addresses the thousands of <entity class="NE" id=5145>Unsullied</entity> , and orders them to kill all of the slave masters in <entity class="NE" id=5133>Astapor</entity> , along with all of their household soldiers and any man who holds a whip . She cautions them to spare any children , and to strike the chains off any slave they see . The <entity class="NE" id=5145>Unsullied</entity> obey her commands without question , and instantly begin attacking all of the assembled slave-masters . <entity class="NE" id=5137>Kraznys</entity> frantically shouts for someone to kill <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> , to which she calmly orders `` dracarys . '' <entity class="NE" id=5139>Drogon</entity> breathes fire onto <entity class="NE" id=5137>Kraznys</entity> , completely engulfing the slaver in flames as he thrashes about in his death throes . Her dragon then flies across the upper walls where the other high-ranking slave masters are watching , burning them all to death . The <entity class="NE" id=5145>Unsullied</entity> proceed to sack the entire city , slaughtering the slave masters and freeing fellow slaves , supported by the fire of <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> ' dragons . After the Sack of <entity class="NE" id=5133>Astapor</entity> is finished , <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> walks past <entity class="NE" id=5137>Kraznys</entity> ' charred remains , mounts a white horse , and addresses her Unsullied . She declares that they have spent their entire lives as slaves , but now she sets them free . If any man wishes to leave , she will not stop him , and no harm will come to him if he goes . She asks the <entity class="NE" id=5145>Unsullied</entity> to stay and fight for her , not as slaves but as free men . For a moment the <entity class="NE" id=5145>Unsullied</entity> stare blankly : they have never known what freedom is . Then one starts tapping the end of his spear against the ground in support , and the others join in , until thousands of Unsullied are triumphantly striking their spears against the ground in praise of <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> . She has what her brother dreamed about for seventeen years but could never find : an army with which to reconquer the <entity class="NE" id=4754>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> marches forward with her army and <entity class="NE" id=5195>Dragons</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4753>Daenerys</entity> rides triumphantly out of the smoking wreck of <entity class="NE" id=5133>Astapor</entity> , and drops the slave-master 's whip on the ground . The <entity class="NE" id=5145>Unsullied</entity> trample the whip under their feet as they march past . She rides out with her eight thousand strong army of Unsullied marching in formation , as her three dragons fly above them . For the first time in generations , a <entity class="NE" id=4851>Targaryen</entity> has begun to conquer again , begining the <entity class="NE" id=5200>Liberation</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5134>Slaver</entity> 's Bay .
