<entity id=6514>Robb</entity> presents himself to <entity id=6515>Walder Frey</entity> , and <entity id=6516>Edmure</entity> meets his bride . <entity id=6517>Jon</entity> faces his harshest test yet . <entity id=6518>Bran</entity> discovers a new gift . <entity id=6519>Daario</entity> and <entity id=6520>Jorah</entity> debate how to take <entity id=6521>Yunkai</entity> . <entity id=6522>House House</entity> joins with <entity id=6523>House Tully</entity> . Across the <entity id=6524>Narrow Sea</entity> . Outside the walls of <entity id=6525>Yunkai</entity> , <entity id=6526>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> and her commanders plan an attack on the city . Her newest captain , <entity id=6527>Daario Naharis</entity> , suggests a plan using a lightly defended back gate , a small group can infiltrate the city and open the main gates for the rest of the army to invade . Though <entity id=6528>Jorah Mormont</entity> is skeptical of both the plan and <entity id=6529>Daario</entity> 's loyalty , <entity id=6530>Daenerys</entity> is convinced to try it when she asks <entity id=6531>Grey Worm</entity> if he trusts <entity id=6529>Daario</entity> . Upon being encouraged to speak his mind , he says he does . <entity id=6532>Daario</entity> also touches her on her hand , flirting for her favor to him . As the captains depart , <entity id=6533>Ser Barristan</entity> asks to go along , but <entity id=6534>Jorah</entity> reminds him that a <entity id=6535>Queensguard</entity> 's place is at the <entity id=6536>Queen</entity> 's side , regardless of his pride . That night <entity id=6537>Ser Jorah</entity> , <entity id=6538>Daario</entity> , and <entity id=6539>Grey Worm</entity> sneak into the city and fight their way through the slave soldiers guarding <entity id=6540>Yunkai</entity> . There are far more soldiers than <entity id=6541>Daario</entity> anticipated , much to <entity id=6542>Jorah</entity> 's irritation , but it seems that the three are evenly matched - barely . A few hours later , an impatient Daenerys paces in her tent , asking <entity id=6543>Barristan</entity> how long a sacking of a city usually takes . <entity id=6544>Jorah</entity> and <entity id=6545>Grey Worm</entity> finally enter , covered in dust and gore but grinning widely : <entity id=6546>Yunkai</entity> is defeated . <entity id=6547>Daenerys</entity> is elated , but asks after <entity id=6548>Daario</entity> , who is still absent . After a suspenseful pause by <entity id=6549>Jorah</entity> , <entity id=6550>Daario</entity> strides into the room and kneels before the Queen . He presents <entity id=6551>Yunkai</entity> 's torn flag and triumphantly says the city is hers . At the <entity id=6552>Wall</entity> . <entity id=6553>North</entity> of the <entity id=6554>Wall</entity> , <entity id=6555>Samwell Tarly</entity> and <entity id=6556>Gilly</entity> continue their march south , after barely escaping an encounter with a <entity id=6557>White Walker</entity> during which <entity id=6558>Sam</entity> actually managed to kill the creature using a dragonglass dagger . <entity id=6559>Sam</entity> tells Gilly about a way to get through the wall . <entity id=6560>Sam</entity> tells Gilly that they are a considerable distance west of <entity id=6561>Castle Black</entity> , but this is n't a problem , because this means they are close to the <entity id=6562>Nightfort</entity> , the original headquarters of the <entity id=6563>Night's Watch</entity> , which was abandoned centuries ago as the organization 's numbers dwindled . <entity id=6564>Sam</entity> explains that he plans to get them across the Wall using a secret sally-port which leads right into the <entity id=6565>Nightfort</entity> . <entity id=6566>Gilly</entity> is amazed that <entity id=6567>Sam</entity> knows so much history just from reading books , insisting that he is a wizard ( much to <entity id=6567>Sam</entity> 's delight ) and is awestruck when she finally catches a glimpse of the <entity id=6568>Wall</entity> . Meanwhile , <entity id=6569>Bran Stark</entity> and his group have passed far enough north that they have left the <entity id=6570>Seven Kingdoms</entity> proper , and entered into the Gift : a stretch of land south of the <entity id=6571>Wall</entity> which was gifted to the <entity id=6572>Night's Watch</entity> thousands of years ago by <entity id=6573>Brandon</entity> the <entity id=6574>Builder</entity> , from which the <entity id=6575>Watch</entity> draws support for its material needs . The Reeds are puzzled , because the <entity id=6576>Gift</entity> possesses good arable land but the countryside is empty . <entity id=6577>Bran</entity> explains , to <entity id=6578>Osha</entity> 's discomfort , that wildling attacks coming over or around the <entity id=6579>Wall</entity> caused most of the smallfolk to flee the <entity id=6580>Gift</entity> over the centuries . Meanwhile , the <entity id=6581>Watch</entity> 's diminishing numbers mean they do n't really need that much support from the <entity id=6582>Gift</entity> anymore , explaining why they have n't encountered any brothers of the <entity id=6581>Watch</entity> working the lands either . <entity id=6583>Bran</entity> 's group takes shelter in an abandoned mill to get out of a thunderstorm . Nearby in the <entity id=6584>Gift</entity> , <entity id=6585>Jon Snow</entity> and the wildling party encounter an old man who lives alone at a small farm where he breeds horses for the <entity id=6586>Night's Watch</entity> . They plan to attack him to steal his horses and gold , but <entity id=6587>Jon</entity> insists that the old man is no threat to them . <entity id=6588>Orell</entity> and <entity id=6589>Tormund Giantsbane</entity> intend to kill the man so as to stop him from alerting the <entity id=6590>Night's Watch</entity> to their presence . However , when the party attacks the farmstead , <entity id=6591>Jon</entity> surreptitiously hits a rock with his sword , alerting the old man who flees ; <entity id=6591>Jon</entity> also distracts <entity id=6592>Ygritte</entity> when she tries to shoot the fleeing man with an arrow . While in the mill , <entity id=6593>Bran</entity> and <entity id=6594>Jojen Reed</entity> discuss how they plan to cross the <entity id=6595>Wall</entity> , before Meera spots the old horse breeder riding nearby . After the old man is captured by the wildlings , <entity id=6596>Hodor —</entity> scared by the thunder — begins yelling , which threatens to give away their location to the wildlings . <entity id=6597>Bran</entity> uses his warg abilities to enter <entity id=6598>Hodor</entity> 's mind and cause him to pass out . <entity id=6599>Summer</entity> attacks a Wildling . <entity id=6600>Outside</entity> , <entity id=6601>Tormund</entity> moves to kill the old man , but <entity id=6602>Orell</entity> tells him to have <entity id=6603>Jon</entity> do it instead to prove his loyalty . <entity id=6604>Jon</entity> is ultimately unable to kill the innocent man , and instead <entity id=6605>Ygritte</entity> kills the man with an arrow . Realizing that <entity id=6606>Jon</entity> is still loyal to the <entity id=6607>Night's Watch</entity> , <entity id=6608>Tormund</entity> orders his men to kill <entity id=6606>Jon</entity> ; <entity id=6608>Tormund</entity> restrains <entity id=6609>Ygritte</entity> to stop her trying to help <entity id=6606>Jon</entity> , and soon after <entity id=6606>Jon</entity> battles with <entity id=6610>Orell</entity> . At the urging of <entity id=6611>Jojen</entity> , <entity id=6612>Bran</entity> enters the mind of <entity id=6613>Summer</entity> , his direwolf , to aid <entity id=6614>Jon</entity> . <entity id=6615>Summer</entity> and <entity id=6616>Shaggydog</entity> kill two wildlings threatening <entity id=6617>Jon</entity> as he battles to the death with <entity id=6618>Orell</entity> and finally kills him . With the last of his strength <entity id=6619>Orell</entity> wargs into the mind of his pet eagle , which swoops down and attacks <entity id=6620>Jon</entity> , clawing him badly about the face before he beats the bird off . <entity id=6621>Jon</entity> then jumps to mount a nearby horse and escapes , leaving <entity id=6622>Ygritte</entity> and heading back to the <entity id=6623>Wall</entity> . <entity id=6624>Jon</entity> kills <entity id=6625>Orell</entity> . That night <entity id=6626>Bran</entity> asks <entity id=6627>Osha</entity> to take <entity id=6628>Rickon</entity> ( who would be heir to Winterfell if anything were to happen to <entity id=6626>Bran</entity> or <entity id=6629>Robb</entity> ) to Last Hearth , the home of <entity id=6630>House Umber</entity> , while he , <entity id=6631>Meera</entity> and <entity id=6632>Jojen</entity> head through the Wall in search of the Three-eyed raven . <entity id=6633>Osha</entity> promises to look after <entity id=6634>Rickon</entity> and orders the <entity id=6635>Reed</entity> siblings to do the same with <entity id=6636>Bran</entity> before she , <entity id=6634>Rickon</entity> , and <entity id=6637>Shaggydog</entity> depart in the dead of night . At the <entity id=6638>Twins</entity> . <entity id=6639>Robb Robb</entity> 's army arrives at the <entity id=6640>Twins</entity> , the castle seat of <entity id=6641>House Frey</entity> , for his uncle <entity id=6642>Edmure</entity> 's wedding . Enduring <entity id=6643>Lord Walder Frey</entity> 's insults directed at him and his wife , <entity id=6644>Robb</entity> makes a public apology to <entity id=6645>Lord Frey</entity> 's daughters and granddaughters for breaking his promise to marry one of them . <entity id=6646>Frey</entity> accepts the apology and offers the <entity id=6647>Starks</entity> and their men his hospitality . That night <entity id=6648>Edmure</entity> is introduced to his bride <entity id=6649>Roslin Frey</entity> , discovering much to his relief that she is a beauty . The wedding and the feast that follows it are quite celebratory and lively affairs , with all the participants in high spirits . <entity id=6650>Edmure</entity> and his new bride . <entity id=6651>Edmure</entity> is clearly in love and his attentions are focused solely on his bride . As the celebrations reach their heights <entity id=6652>Lord Walder</entity> calls for the bedding ceremony . <entity id=6653>Robb</entity> agrees and the bride and groom are carried off to their wedding bed , <entity id=6654>Roslin</entity> carried off by the male guests and followed closely by <entity id=6655>Edmure</entity> , who is collected by the <entity id=6656>Frey</entity> women . <entity id=6657>Brynden Brynden</entity> , having drunk too much wine , excuses himself from the celebration to `` find a tree to piss on . `` . After they leave and the festivities begin to wind down , <entity id=6658>Catelyn</entity> becomes suspicious when she notices <entity id=6659>Black Walder Rivers</entity> close the banquet hall doors and the musicians in the gallery begin playing `` The <entity id=6660>Rains</entity> of Castamere '' – the song commemorating <entity id=6661>House Lannister</entity> 's decisive and brutal victory against the rebellious <entity id=6662>House Reyne</entity> of Castamere years ago . <entity id=6663>Walder</entity> rises to make a toast to <entity id=6664>Robb</entity> , and <entity id=6665>Catelyn</entity> , seated beside <entity id=6666>Lord Roose Bolton</entity> , notices that the latter is wearing mail under his clothing . Realizing they are in a trap , <entity id=6667>Catelyn</entity> slaps <entity id=6668>Roose</entity> across the face and screams a warning to <entity id=6669>Robb</entity> , but by then it is too late . <entity id=6670>Lord Lord</entity> signals his men to attack . <entity id=6671>Talisa</entity> is stabbed by <entity id=6672>Lame Lothar</entity> . In what becomes known as the infamous Red Wedding , <entity id=6673>Lothar</entity> draws a knife and repeatedly stabs the pregnant Talisa in the stomach , killing her unborn child . <entity id=6674>Talisa</entity> collapses to the ground as chaos surrounds . Before he can react , <entity id=6675>Robb</entity> is shot by the musicians with crossbows several times and falls to the ground . Numerous other Stark men are killed by the crossbow bolts or set upon by <entity id=6676>Frey</entity> soldiers . <entity id=6677>Catelyn</entity> is shot by one of the musicians in the back and falls to the ground . <entity id=6678>Outside</entity> , <entity id=6679>Arya Stark</entity> and the <entity id=6680>Hound</entity> , having arrived at the Twins in disguise , are turned away by <entity id=6681>Frey</entity> guards at the time the massacre begins . <entity id=6682>Arya</entity> gives <entity id=6683>Sandor</entity> the slip and sneaks past the gate guards , only to witness <entity id=6684>Frey</entity> men kill <entity id=6685>Stark</entity> soldiers and <entity id=6686>Grey Wind</entity> , <entity id=6687>Robb</entity> 's direwolf . She makes a desperate run for the castle , but is stopped by the <entity id=6688>Hound</entity> , who tells her that it is too late . When <entity id=6689>Arya</entity> wo n't stop , <entity id=6690>Sandor</entity> knocks her unconscious before carrying her out of the castle to safety . <entity id=6691>Grey Grey</entity> is shot dead by <entity id=6692>Frey</entity> crossbowman . A wounded <entity id=6693>Catelyn</entity> crawls to safety beneath a table as <entity id=6694>Walder</entity> motions the soldiers to cease . <entity id=6695>Walder</entity> mocks <entity id=6696>Robb</entity> as he limps to his dying wife . He holds <entity id=6697>Talisa</entity> in his arms as she dies . <entity id=6698>Catelyn</entity> sees an opportunity and limps out from under the table to seize out from under <entity id=6699>Walder</entity> 's table his cowering young wife , <entity id=6700>Joyeuse</entity> . <entity id=6701>Catelyn</entity> holds a knife to the girl 's throat and threatens to kill her if <entity id=6702>Walder</entity> does not negotiate an end to the attack . <entity id=6703>Walder</entity> refuses her , recalling the previous betrayed oath made that <entity id=6704>Robb</entity> would marry his daughter . She begs they take her hostage and that <entity id=6705>Robb</entity> , who merely lingers despondent and heartbroken beside his wife 's corpse , be allowed to leave . <entity id=6706>Catelyn</entity> kills <entity id=6707>Walder Frey</entity> 's wife , the <entity id=6708>Lady Joyeuse</entity> , moments before being killed herself . He questions why he should agree to such terms to which <entity id=6709>Catelyn</entity> responds by swearing on her honor as both a Tully and a Stark that if he does not let <entity id=6710>Robb</entity> go she will kill his wife . <entity id=6711>Walder</entity> chuckles and nonchalantly responds , `` I 'll find another . '' <entity id=6712>Robb</entity> stands and utters , `` Mother '' as ​Roose <entity id=6713>Bolton</entity> , who had fled the hall when the massacre began , seizes <entity id=6712>Robb</entity> , whispering `` The <entity id=6714>Lannisters</entity> send their regards , '' before stabbing him in the heart . <entity id=6715>Robb</entity> maintains eye contact with <entity id=6716>Catelyn</entity> as he collapses to the floor . Mad with grief at the death of her firstborn son , <entity id=6717>Catelyn</entity> cries out in anguish and kills Walder's wife , fulfilling her promise . Now catatonic with grief , she stands there and accepts her fate , allowing <entity id=6718>Black Walder</entity> to slip up behind her and viciously cut her throat . She falls to the floor with a thud .
