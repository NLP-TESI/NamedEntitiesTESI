King 's Landing hosts a wedding , and <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6282>Sansa</entity> spend the night together . <entity class="NE" id=6283>Dany</entity> meets the <entity class="NE" id=6284>Titan</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=6285>Bastard</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6286>Davos</entity> demands proof from <entity class="NE" id=6287>Melisandre</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6288>Sam</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6289>Gilly</entity> meet an older gentleman . Across the <entity class="NE" id=6290>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6291>Daenerys</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6292>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6293>Barristan</entity> hide behind a ruined building to spy on the encampment of the <entity class="NE" id=6294>Second Sons</entity> , a professional mercenary company , the `` powerful friends '' the <entity class="NE" id=6295>Yunkish</entity> have employed . <entity class="NE" id=6293>Barristan</entity> explains that although there are only 2,000 of them , the <entity class="NE" id=6294>Second Sons</entity> are armored and mounted , enough to cause trouble for the <entity class="NE" id=6298>Unsullied</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6291>Daenerys</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=6293>Barristan</entity> to organize a meeting with the <entity class="NE" id=6294>Second Sons</entity> ' captains , saying that men who fight for gold `` ca n't afford to lose to a girl . `` . Shortly thereafter , <entity class="NE" id=6291>Daenerys</entity> hosts the captains <entity class="NE" id=6303>Mero</entity> , a <entity class="NE" id=6304>Braavosi</entity> also known as the <entity class="NE" id=6284>Titan</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=6285>Bastard</entity> , and Prendahl na <entity class="NE" id=6307>Ghezn</entity> , a Ghiscari . Also in attendance is <entity class="NE" id=6308>Prendahl</entity> 's capable and striking lieutenant , <entity class="NE" id=6309>Daario Naharis</entity> . The uncouth and sexually vulgar <entity class="NE" id=6303>Mero</entity> makes himself at home , observes that <entity class="NE" id=6291>Daenerys</entity> looks like a whore he knows in <entity class="NE" id=6312>Lys</entity> and feels up <entity class="NE" id=6313>Missandei</entity> , although the surprisingly gracious queen shrugs his insults off . Prendahl and <entity class="NE" id=6303>Mero</entity> refuse <entity class="NE" id=6291>Daenerys</entity> ' offer of an alliance , pointing out they will not get their rewards until she reclaims the <entity class="NE" id=6316>Iron Throne</entity> , which is still a distant prospect . With aplomb she replies that a fortnight previous she had no army , and a year before that she had no dragons . Smiling gently she gives them two days to make a decision and sends them off with a barrel of wine <entity class="NE" id=6303>Mero</entity> had demanded . <entity class="NE" id=6318>Daario</entity> smiles over his back at her as they depart . Once the sellswords are gone , <entity class="NE" id=6291>Daenerys</entity> drops her pretence of cordiality and while glowering at <entity class="NE" id=6303>Mero</entity> 's back , instructs <entity class="NE" id=6293>Barristan</entity> that if they must fight the <entity class="NE" id=6294>Second Sons</entity> , he is to kill <entity class="NE" id=6303>Mero</entity> first . <entity class="NE" id=6323>Selmy</entity> replies that he would be glad to do so . At the mercenary camp , <entity class="NE" id=6303>Mero</entity> fondles a <entity class="NE" id=6295>Yunkish</entity> pleasure-slave while discussing the situation with <entity class="NE" id=6308>Prendahl</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6318>Daario</entity> . It swiftly becomes apparent that <entity class="NE" id=6318>Daario</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6303>Mero</entity> do not agree , but Prendahl cuts off their philosophical discussion to call for action over `` the dragon bitch . '' They eventually decide to simply assassinate <entity class="NE" id=6291>Daenerys</entity> and be done with it . <entity class="NE" id=6303>Mero</entity> gives the slave three coins , one each from <entity class="NE" id=6332>Volantis</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6333>Meereen</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=6334>Braavos</entity> , and tells her to randomly give them to the three mercenaries â€“ the one who gets the <entity class="NE" id=6304>Braavosi</entity> coin will kill the queen . <entity class="NE" id=6318>Daario</entity> ( dressed as an Unsullied ) holds a knife at <entity class="NE" id=6313>Missandei</entity> 's throat . That night , as <entity class="NE" id=6291>Daenerys</entity> bathes , she is surprised to learn that <entity class="NE" id=6313>Missandei</entity> speaks no fewer than nineteen languages . <entity class="NE" id=6313>Missandei</entity> says this should n't be that odd , since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of <entity class="NE" id=6341>Dothraki</entity> . The khaleesi bristles at the idea she speaks only reasonable <entity class="NE" id=6341>Dothraki</entity> and switches to the language to teach Missandei a lesson , only to have her pronunciation corrected . Suddenly , an Unsullied enters and hold a knife to <entity class="NE" id=6313>Missandei</entity> 's throat , advising the women not to scream . He removes his helmet , revealing himself as <entity class="NE" id=6318>Daario</entity> . He explains that he is here to kill <entity class="NE" id=6291>Daenerys</entity> on orders from his captains , but they ran into a `` philosophical disagreement '' over her beauty . He then produces their severed heads . Intrigued , <entity class="NE" id=6291>Daenerys</entity> rises from her bath and asks if <entity class="NE" id=6318>Daario</entity> will swear fealty to her . He bends the knee and swears his sword , his men and his heart to <entity class="NE" id=6291>Daenerys</entity> . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=6349>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6288>Sam</entity> slays a <entity class="NE" id=6351>White Walker</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6352>Samwell Samwell</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6289>Gilly</entity> continue on their journey to <entity class="NE" id=6354>Castle Black</entity> , taking refuge in a destroyed cabin next to a heart tree . Before they enter , two crows land on a branch on the heart tree , and begin to squawk loudly . Later at night , <entity class="NE" id=6288>Sam</entity> tries to light a fire , but is frustrated in his attempts ; <entity class="NE" id=6289>Gilly</entity> tries and does it easily . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=6288>Sam</entity> suggests that <entity class="NE" id=6289>Gilly</entity> name her son , but she does not know any boy names . <entity class="NE" id=6288>Sam</entity> gives her some examples , and also explains the difference between first and last names . Gilly likes the name <entity class="NE" id=6360>Randyll</entity> , Sam's father 's first name , but <entity class="NE" id=6288>Sam</entity> asks her not to give the child that name . <entity class="NE" id=6288>Sam</entity> shares the truth about his father and his upbringing marked by cruelty which they both have in common . Suddenly , they are interrupted by a thunderous squawking of the crows . <entity class="NE" id=6288>Sam</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6289>Gilly</entity> go outside to investigate , and discover hundreds of crows filling the nearby tree and on the structure itself screeching violently . Gilly is then horrified to see a <entity class="NE" id=6351>White Walker</entity> approaching them , and knows that it is after her child . <entity class="NE" id=6288>Sam</entity> tries to halt its advance , but the <entity class="NE" id=6367>Walker</entity> shatters his sword with its bare hand and knocks him aside , then continues to bear down upon her . As the monster reaches out to seize the infant , <entity class="NE" id=6288>Sam</entity> staggers back to his feet , pulls out his dragonglass dagger , and attacks the <entity class="NE" id=6367>Walker</entity> , stabbing it in the back . The <entity class="NE" id=6367>Walker</entity> howls in pain as its whole body begins to freeze from the point at which it was stabbed . It falls to its knees , and shatters , leaving nothing but white dust and the dagger . The dagger is left behind as <entity class="NE" id=6288>Sam</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6289>Gilly</entity> race away in a panic . The crows fly out of the trees and chase them , screaming their hatred . In the <entity class="NE" id=6373>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6374>Arya Arya</entity> , now a captive of <entity class="NE" id=6375>Sandor Clegane</entity> after he kidnapped her from the <entity class="NE" id=6376>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> , picks up a rock and stands over him planning to strike . She thinks he is sound asleep . He opens his eyes and tells her she has one chance to hit him , and kill him , but if she fails he will break her hands . Later she sits on the horse with him sullen and refusing food he offers her . <entity class="NE" id=6377>Sandor</entity> points out that for all she hates him , <entity class="NE" id=6378>Arya</entity> could have been taken captive by someone far worse . He tells her about <entity class="NE" id=6282>Sansa</entity> and how he rescued her from a group of would-be rapists . <entity class="NE" id=6378>Arya</entity> disbelieves this , but <entity class="NE" id=6377>Sandor</entity> says `` Ask your sister if you ever see her again . '' They arrive at a river which <entity class="NE" id=6378>Arya</entity> initially thinks to be the <entity class="NE" id=6383>Blackwater</entity> . Rather confused with her lack of understanding he points out that the river is the <entity class="NE" id=6384>Red Fork</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=6385>Trident</entity> . Arya believed he was taking her back to <entity class="NE" id=6386>King</entity> 's Landing , but he reveals that he is in fact taking her to The <entity class="NE" id=6387>Twins</entity> , where her mother and brother will shortly be attending her uncle 's wedding , and he will ransom her to them . He tells her ruefully that if she was n't so busy trying to kill him they might make it in time for the wedding . <entity class="NE" id=6378>Arya</entity> has a small and hidden smile as the <entity class="NE" id=6389>Hound</entity> spurs the horse to a gallop . <entity class="NE" id=6287>Melisandre</entity> finally arrives back at <entity class="NE" id=6391>Dragonstone</entity> with <entity class="NE" id=6392>Gendry</entity> in tow . <entity class="NE" id=6393>Stannis</entity> is less than impressed by the sight of the bastard boy who is technically his nephew and is bemused when <entity class="NE" id=6287>Melisandre</entity> orders him fed , bathed and clothed . He believes it is pointless as they intend to sacrifice him , but <entity class="NE" id=6287>Melisandre</entity> reveals it is merely a sham to keep <entity class="NE" id=6392>Gendry</entity> feeling secure , in much the same way as keeping a sacrificial lamb from seeing the blade of the knife . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=6397>Davos Seaworth</entity> , still languishing in his cell , is paid a visit by <entity class="NE" id=6393>Stannis</entity> ; <entity class="NE" id=6286>Davos</entity> is told of the impending sacrifice of <entity class="NE" id=6392>Gendry</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6286>Davos</entity> protests this saying that unlike <entity class="NE" id=6402>Renly</entity> who was a rebel against his rightful king , <entity class="NE" id=6392>Gendry</entity> is an innocent who has never done him any wrong . <entity class="NE" id=6393>Stannis</entity> argues that the sacrifice of one bastard boy will usher in his victory , which <entity class="NE" id=6393>Stannis</entity> believes is the only way to save every man , woman and child in <entity class="NE" id=6405>Westeros</entity> from the coming darkness that will devour everything in its path . He asks how <entity class="NE" id=6286>Davos</entity> can doubt the power of <entity class="NE" id=6287>Melisandre</entity> 's God when <entity class="NE" id=6393>Stannis</entity> has seen visions of `` a great battle in the snow '' and <entity class="NE" id=6286>Davos</entity> saw the creature she gave birth to . <entity class="NE" id=6286>Davos</entity> speculates that the real reason <entity class="NE" id=6393>Stannis</entity> came is because deep down , a part of him knows what he 's about to do is wrong and he knew <entity class="NE" id=6286>Davos</entity> would tell him the truth he needs to hear , regardless of how it would be taken . After extracting a promise from <entity class="NE" id=6286>Davos</entity> that he wo n't act against <entity class="NE" id=6287>Melisandre</entity> again , <entity class="NE" id=6393>Stannis</entity> has him released . Stannis naming the 3 usurpers . In <entity class="NE" id=6392>Gendry</entity> 's quarters , <entity class="NE" id=6287>Melisandre</entity> seduces <entity class="NE" id=6392>Gendry</entity> long enough to distract him , then promptly ties him to the bed and places leeches on his body . She explains as <entity class="NE" id=6393>Stannis</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6286>Davos</entity> enter the room that <entity class="NE" id=6286>Davos</entity> wanted a demonstration of the power in king 's blood , then removes the leeches and lights a fire in a nearby brazier . As part of the magical ritual that follows , <entity class="NE" id=6393>Stannis</entity> throws the leeches into the flames at <entity class="NE" id=6287>Melisandre</entity> 's direction , and recites the names of three people he wants dead as they burn : `` The usurper <entity class="NE" id=6420>Robb Stark</entity> , the usurper <entity class="NE" id=6421>Balon Greyjoy</entity> , the usurper <entity class="NE" id=6422>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> . `` . At <entity class="NE" id=6386>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> speaks with <entity class="NE" id=6282>Sansa</entity> before their wedding at the <entity class="NE" id=6426>Great Sept</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=6427>Baelor</entity> ; though he knows the girl is not thrilled at the prospect of marrying him . <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> promises Sansa that he will not mistreat her , and <entity class="NE" id=6282>Sansa</entity> agrees there are worse Lannisters she could be wed to . Prior to the wedding , <entity class="NE" id=6430>Margaery Tyrell</entity> tries to ingratiate herself to <entity class="NE" id=6431>Cersei</entity> , commenting they will technically be sisters soon ; <entity class="NE" id=6431>Cersei</entity> responds by telling Margaery the story behind the `` Rains of <entity class="NE" id=6432>Castamere</entity> , '' relating how it refers to the destruction of <entity class="HSE" id=6433>House Reyne</entity> of Castamere after their failed rebellion against <entity class="HSE" id=6434>House Lannister</entity> ( inferring similarities between the ambitions and position of <entity class="NE" id=6435>Houses Reyne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6436>Tyrell</entity> and that the same fate may fall upon <entity class="HSE" id=6437>House Tyrell</entity> if they plot against the <entity class="NE" id=6438>Lannisters</entity> ) and concludes by threatening to have <entity class="NE" id=6439>Margaery</entity> strangled in her sleep if she ever dares call Cersei sister again . The ceremony is a grim affair ; <entity class="NE" id=6440>Joffrey</entity> smugly escorts <entity class="NE" id=6282>Sansa</entity> to the altar in place of her father and petulantly removes the stool upon which <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> was to stand on to cloak <entity class="NE" id=6282>Sansa</entity> in Lannister colors as part of the ceremony , eliciting snickers from the congregation ( though the scowl of <entity class="NE" id=6443>Lord Tywin</entity> quickly silences them ) . <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> in the face of humiliation asks <entity class="NE" id=6282>Sansa</entity> to kneel and he places the cloak around her shoulders . The new High <entity class="NE" id=6446>Septon</entity> begins the ceremony . Later as man and wife they have their reception dinner , which also proves a grim and miserable affair . Tyrions threatens <entity class="NE" id=6440>Joffrey</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> spends the wedding feast mostly by getting deeply drunk and making light of his father 's insistence that his inebriated state will render him unfit to impregnate his wife . <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> , drunkenly proclaiming himself `` the god of tits and wine , '' reminds his father that <entity class="NE" id=6450>Tywin</entity> has long called him `` a drunken little lust-filled beast , '' so doing his duty in the marriage bed will not pose a problem . At the same time , <entity class="NE" id=6440>Joffrey</entity> is himself drinking too much wine , and losing what few inhibitions he has , his behavior becomes increasingly offensive to both <entity class="NE" id=6282>Sansa</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6454>Against Against</entity> 's ineffectual protests , <entity class="NE" id=6440>Joffrey</entity> gets up and , flanked by his <entity class="NE" id=6456>Kingsguard</entity> , taunts Sansa that she 's still found a way to marry a Lannister . <entity class="NE" id=6440>Joffrey</entity> then ponders that it does n't matter which <entity class="NE" id=6458>Lannister</entity> gets her pregnant , and openly says he might want to rape her after <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> is done with her , while the <entity class="NE" id=6456>Kingsguard</entity> hold her down . <entity class="NE" id=6440>Joffrey</entity> then declares it time for the bedding ceremony ( which involves the men at the wedding stripping the bride and the women stripping the groom before carrying them off to the marriage bed ) but <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> angrily insists there will be no bedding ceremony . When <entity class="NE" id=6440>Joffrey</entity> keeps pushing the matter , <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> slams his dagger into the table and threatens that <entity class="NE" id=6440>Joffrey</entity> will `` be fucking [ his ] own bride with a wooden cock '' if he does n't let it drop . As the court stands in shocked silence , <entity class="NE" id=6440>Joffrey</entity> seethes with outrage and <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> defiantly glares at his nephew with pure hatred . After a tense moment , <entity class="NE" id=6450>Tywin</entity> defuses the situation by agreeing that there will be no bedding ceremony , and placates <entity class="NE" id=6440>Joffrey</entity> by claiming <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> 's outburst is merely the result of his being extremely drunk . Taking the hint , <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> visibly swallows his anger and begins to act far more drunk than he actually is , intentionally humiliating himself , and says he only made a bad joke . It is n't clear if anyone in the room , including <entity class="NE" id=6450>Tywin</entity> or <entity class="NE" id=6440>Joffrey</entity> , think that <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> 's outburst was simply due to being very drunk , but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass . <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> , while pretending to be so drunk he can barely stand , escorts Sansa to their bedchamber . Once they are alone in their quarters , a tense moment passes as <entity class="NE" id=6282>Sansa</entity> nervously and slowly undresses . <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> ultimately tells her to stop , deciding that he will not consummate the marriage if she does not want to , and only will if she changes her mind . When <entity class="NE" id=6282>Sansa</entity> questions what he will do if she never does , <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> sarcastically jokes `` And so my watch begins '' - implying that his marriage will be celibate for all time like a brother of the <entity class="NE" id=6479>Night's Watch</entity> - and then abruptly passes out on a nearby couch . The following morning , <entity class="NE" id=6480>Shae</entity> notices with a hint of a smile that <entity class="NE" id=6282>Sansa</entity> 's bed sheets are not stained with blood and <entity class="NE" id=6281>Tyrion</entity> 's virgin bride is still a virgin .
