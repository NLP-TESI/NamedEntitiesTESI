<entity class="NE" id=6688>Joffrey</entity> challenges <entity class="NE" id=6689>Tywin</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6690>Bran</entity> tells a ghost story . In <entity class="NE" id=6691>Dragonstone</entity> , mercy comes from strange quarters . <entity class="NE" id=6692>Dany</entity> waits to see if she is a conqueror or a liberator . In the <entity class="NE" id=6693>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=6694>Twins</entity> , the carnage at the <entity class="NE" id=6695>Red Wedding</entity> continues to unfold . While the <entity class="NE" id=6696>Northern</entity> lords are being slaughtered in the main hall , outside the walls of the castle <entity class="HSE" id=6697>House Frey</entity> soldiers ambush the <entity class="NE" id=6698>Stark</entity> army in its own camp . What follows is not a battle but a one-sided massacre as the <entity class="NE" id=6699>Northern</entity> army is taken completely by surprise due to the betrayal of their supposed allies . The betrayers torch all of the camp 's tents , with many men burning alive inside of them . <entity class="NE" id=6700>Frey</entity> men wildly mutilate the dead and dying . From one of the twin towers of the <entity class="NE" id=6701>Frey</entity> stronghold , <entity class="NE" id=6702>Roose Bolton</entity> watches the massacre . <entity class="NE" id=6703>Robb</entity> 's corpse desecrated , with his direwolf 's head sewn in place of his own . <entity class="NE" id=6704>Sandor Sandor</entity> attempts to slip away amidst the carnage on a horse , along with the unconscious <entity class="NE" id=6705>Arya Stark</entity> , by casually riding away while carrying a <entity class="NE" id=6706>Frey</entity> banner . Before they can leave , <entity class="NE" id=6707>Arya</entity> regains consciousness - as she and the <entity class="NE" id=6708>Hound</entity> turn to see a group of <entity class="NE" id=6709>Frey</entity> men shouting as they march through the main gate . The <entity class="NE" id=6710>Freys</entity> have horrifically desecrated <entity class="NE" id=6711>Robb Stark</entity> 's corpse by decapitating it , then crudely attaching the severed head of his direwolf <entity class="NE" id=6712>Grey Wind</entity> in its place . <entity class="NE" id=6713>Drunk</entity> with `` victory '' , the <entity class="NE" id=6714>Freys</entity> gleefully parade the mutilated body around the castle on a horse while mockingly chanting `` King in the <entity class="NE" id=6715>North</entity> ! King in the <entity class="NE" id=6716>North</entity> ! Here he comes , the King in the <entity class="NE" id=6717>North</entity> ! `` , which is met with by cheers and peals of laughter from the crowds of <entity class="NE" id=6718>Frey</entity> soldiers . <entity class="NE" id=6719>Sandor</entity> is horrified by the gruesome spectacle , while he holds <entity class="NE" id=6720>Arya</entity> , who looks on with a dead stare . The <entity class="NE" id=6721>Hound</entity> rides away with her , undisturbed thanks to the <entity class="NE" id=6722>Frey</entity> banner in his hand . In the great hall of the castle the following morning , as servants clean up the pools of blood left by their former wedding guests , <entity class="NE" id=6723>Lords Walder Frey</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6724>Roose Bolton</entity> gloat over their victory and the rewards their treachery has won them . <entity class="NE" id=6725>Frey</entity> will become <entity class="NE" id=6726>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=6727>Riverrun</entity> , and the <entity class="NE" id=6728>Freys</entity> will replace the <entity class="NE" id=6729>Tullys</entity> as the <entity class="NE" id=6730>Lannisters</entity> ' vassals in the <entity class="NE" id=6731>Riverlands</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6732>Bolton</entity> has been appointed as the new Warden of the <entity class="NE" id=6733>North</entity> , replacing the <entity class="NE" id=6734>Starks</entity> - though <entity class="NE" id=6735>Tywin Lannister</entity> intends to eventually give the position to a future Lannister heir produced by <entity class="NE" id=6736>Tyrion Lannister</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6737>Sansa Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6738>Bolton</entity> expresses his concern that <entity class="NE" id=6739>Brynden Tully</entity> escaped the massacre , but <entity class="NE" id=6740>Walder</entity> dismisses his worries , pointing out that the <entity class="NE" id=6741>Blackfish</entity> - and the remaining <entity class="NE" id=6742>Tully</entity> garrison at <entity class="NE" id=6743>Riverrun</entity> - is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the <entity class="NE" id=6744>Lannisters</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6745>Boltons</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=6746>Freys</entity> , although <entity class="NE" id=6738>Bolton</entity> is still visibly concerned . <entity class="NE" id=6747>Bolton</entity> makes plain his contempt for <entity class="NE" id=6748>Robb Stark</entity> , considering the late boy-king arrogant , politically incompetent , and unwilling to take <entity class="NE" id=6749>Roose</entity> 's advice and make the hard decisions needed to win . <entity class="NE" id=6750>Walder</entity> questions Roose if he intends to rule the <entity class="NE" id=6751>North</entity> from <entity class="NE" id=6752>Winterfell</entity> , and he says that he might move his ruling seat there at some future time , after it is rebuilt . This leads Walder to ask how <entity class="NE" id=6753>Winterfell</entity> ended up a ruin . <entity class="NE" id=6754>Roose</entity> explains that his bastard son <entity class="NE" id=6755>Ramsay Snow</entity> offered <entity class="NE" id=6756>Robb Stark</entity> 's terms that the ironborn occupiers would be shown mercy if they handed over Theon Greyjoy , but when they did they learned that <entity class="NE" id=6757>Ramsay</entity> , in his father 's words , `` has his own way of doing things '' . At the <entity class="NE" id=6758>Dreadfort</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6759>Ramsay Snow</entity> eats his breakfast of a thick sausage , taunting Theon about his recent emasculation by pointing to his sewn up and blood-stained trousers , and laughing as Theon finally begs for death as a release from the nightmare . <entity class="NE" id=6760>Ramsay</entity> tells him that he is more valuable alive than dead so the answer must be no . <entity class="NE" id=6761>Ramsay</entity> notes that Theon reeks , and decides that that shall be his new name : Reek . <entity class="NE" id=6762>Theon</entity> refuses to acknowledge the name , twice insisting that he is Theon Greyjoy , but after <entity class="NE" id=6763>Ramsay</entity> beats him , he finally breaks down and says his name is <entity class="NE" id=6764>Reek</entity> . â€‹On <entity class="NE" id=6765>Pyke</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6766>Balon Greyjoy</entity> reads a message from <entity class="NE" id=6767>Lord Bolton</entity> 's bastard while his daughter <entity class="NE" id=6768>Yara Greyjoy</entity> cautiously opens a box crudely carved with the <entity class="NE" id=6769>Greyjoy</entity> kraken . As <entity class="NE" id=6770>Ramsay</entity> 's letter explains the box contains `` Theon 's favorite toy . '' The message bluntly says that the ironborn have until the full moon to withdraw from the <entity class="NE" id=6771>North</entity> or receive more bits and pieces of <entity class="NE" id=6772>Theon</entity> . In addition any remaining ironborn will be flayed alive - just as <entity class="NE" id=6773>Ramsay</entity> flayed alive Theon 's twenty ironborn followers at <entity class="NE" id=6774>Winterfell</entity> after they surrendered , even though he had promised them safe passage . It was in fact <entity class="NE" id=6775>Ramsay Snow</entity> and his soldiers from <entity class="HSE" id=6776>House Bolton</entity> who burned <entity class="NE" id=6777>Winterfell</entity> to the ground : he simply sent false reports for his father Roose to deliver to <entity class="NE" id=6778>Robb Stark</entity> which claimed that the ironborn were responsible , as the <entity class="NE" id=6779>Boltons</entity> were preparing to betray the <entity class="NE" id=6780>Starks</entity> months before the <entity class="NE" id=6781>Red Wedding</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6782>Balon</entity> acts indifferent to <entity class="NE" id=6783>Theon</entity> 's situation since he defied <entity class="NE" id=6782>Balon</entity> 's orders and <entity class="NE" id=6784>Yara</entity> 's common sense when he stayed at <entity class="NE" id=6785>Winterfell</entity> . Furthermore , he can not further the <entity class="NE" id=6786>Greyjoy</entity> line as the contents of the box prove . However , <entity class="NE" id=6787>Yara</entity> does not share her father 's attitude toward her last living brother . She announces her intention to take her fastest ship with her fifty best men , sail around <entity class="NE" id=6788>Westeros</entity> , besiege the <entity class="NE" id=6789>Dreadfort</entity> , and liberate Theon . In the <entity class="NE" id=6790>Riverlands</entity> , a despondent <entity class="NE" id=6791>Arya Stark</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6792>Sandor Clegane</entity> ride away from the outskirts of the <entity class="NE" id=6793>Twins</entity> . They pass close to a small group of <entity class="NE" id=6794>Frey</entity> men , one of whom is bragging about being one of the men who cut off <entity class="NE" id=6795>Grey Wind</entity> 's head and attached it to <entity class="NE" id=6796>Robb Stark</entity> 's body . <entity class="NE" id=6797>Arya</entity> approaches them and sweetly asks to warm herself by the fire . She offers the coin given to her by <entity class="NE" id=6798>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> as payment . When the <entity class="NE" id=6799>Frey</entity> man investigates , she stabs him in the neck . Slightly thrown , the <entity class="NE" id=6800>Hound</entity> deals with the others before demanding to know where <entity class="NE" id=6801>Arya</entity> got the knife . She reveals it 's his . He admonishes her to let him know the next time she plans to do something like that . As he grumbles and cleans up the bodies , <entity class="NE" id=6802>Arya</entity> whispers , `` valar morghulis '' . Meanwhile , in <entity class="NE" id=6803>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=6804>Tyrion Lannister</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6805>Sansa Stark</entity> walk through the gardens . A pair of passing gentlemen snigger at <entity class="NE" id=6806>Tyrion</entity> , either for his dwarf status or due to rumors he has not consummated his marriage . <entity class="NE" id=6807>Sansa</entity> tells him to pay them no mind . <entity class="NE" id=6808>Tyrion</entity> reminds <entity class="NE" id=6809>Sansa</entity> that he 's used to it , as he 's always been a dwarf . He also states that he 's not <entity class="NE" id=6810>Joffrey</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6811>Tyrion</entity> would rather bide his time and humiliate them . <entity class="NE" id=6812>Sansa</entity> playfully follows his line of thinking , and suggests `` sheep-shifting '' - secretly hiding sheep 's dung deep within a mattress ( as <entity class="NE" id=6813>Arya</entity> used to do to her ) , so that the target always wakes up smelling of dung . <entity class="NE" id=6814>Tyrion</entity> is amused but is confused by the term , though he realizes belatedly that <entity class="NE" id=6815>Sansa</entity> has misheard the word `` shit '' . He is rescued from having to explain his wife 's mistake by <entity class="NE" id=6816>Podrick Payne</entity> , who calls him to a meeting of the <entity class="NE" id=6817>Small Council</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=6818>Tywin</entity> 's chambers <entity class="NE" id=6819>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> dithers over giving Tyrion a coded message from <entity class="NE" id=6820>Lord Frey</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6821>Joffrey</entity> jubilantly explains its meaning that <entity class="NE" id=6822>Robb</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6823>Catelyn Stark</entity> are both dead . <entity class="NE" id=6824>Tyrion</entity> is visibly startled by the news , already foreseeing the long-term problems that the incident will cause , but <entity class="NE" id=6825>Joffrey</entity> brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve <entity class="NE" id=6826>Robb</entity> 's severed head to <entity class="NE" id=6827>Sansa</entity> at his wedding feast . None of the <entity class="NE" id=6828>Small Council</entity> are able to mask how distasteful they find the concept . <entity class="NE" id=6829>Varys</entity> points out that <entity class="NE" id=6830>Sansa</entity> is <entity class="NE" id=6831>Joffrey</entity> 's aunt by marriage now ( and it would be unseemly not to give her the basic respect that accords ) . A deeply embarrassed Cersei forces a smile and insists to the rest of the council that <entity class="NE" id=6832>Joffrey</entity> was only joking and did not mean it . This puzzles <entity class="NE" id=6833>Joffrey</entity> , who matter-of-factly states to his mother that he did mean it , and he will have <entity class="NE" id=6834>Robb</entity> 's head served at his wedding feast . <entity class="NE" id=6835>Tyrion</entity> flatly forbids it and tells <entity class="NE" id=6836>Joffrey</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=6837>Sansa</entity> is n't his to torment anymore . <entity class="NE" id=6838>Joffrey</entity> angrily proclaims that he is the king , and everyone is his to torment . <entity class="NE" id=6839>Tywin</entity> counters that a king who has to remind his subjects that he is the king , is no king . <entity class="NE" id=6840>Joffrey</entity> goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather , deriding <entity class="NE" id=6841>Tywin</entity> as a coward who hid under <entity class="NE" id=6842>Casterly Rock</entity> while <entity class="NE" id=6840>Joffrey</entity> 's father King <entity class="NE" id=6843>Robert</entity> won the real war when he overthrew the <entity class="NE" id=6844>Targaryens</entity> . The entire <entity class="NE" id=6845>Small Council</entity> tenses waiting for <entity class="NE" id=6846>Tywin</entity> to respond to this shocking insult : instead <entity class="NE" id=6846>Tywin</entity> coldly and calmly declares that the king is tired and advises the <entity class="NE" id=6847>Queen Regent</entity> to see him to bed . <entity class="NE" id=6848>Joffrey</entity> weakly protests that he is not tired but leaves with his mother , and <entity class="NE" id=6849>Tywin</entity> also asks <entity class="NE" id=6850>Pycelle</entity> to give his grandson a sedative to make sure he goes to sleep . <entity class="NE" id=6851>Tywin</entity> dismisses the rest of the council , save <entity class="NE" id=6852>Tyrion</entity> , who drily notes that the <entity class="NE" id=6853>Lord</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=6854>Seven Kingdoms</entity> has been sent to bed without his supper . He confronts Tywin about his part in the <entity class="NE" id=6855>Red Wedding</entity> , and deduces that his father must have orchestrated it , as <entity class="NE" id=6856>Walder Frey</entity> is not brave enough to have carried it out on his own . The <entity class="NE" id=6857>Hand</entity> blithely confirms this . He dismisses <entity class="NE" id=6858>Tyrion</entity> 's concerns that the <entity class="NE" id=6859>Northerners</entity> will never forget nor forgive such an outrage , arguing he wants them to remember so that it will make them wary of rebelling again . <entity class="NE" id=6860>Tyrion</entity> shows his distaste for <entity class="NE" id=6861>Tywin</entity> 's choice of a wedding as the place to inflict the slaughter , but <entity class="NE" id=6861>Tywin</entity> responds , asking why killing ten thousand soldiers in battle is nobler than killing a dozen guests at a wedding . <entity class="NE" id=6862>Tywin</entity> again waxes poetic about family , noting <entity class="NE" id=6863>Tyrion</entity> 's failure to consummate his marriage to <entity class="NE" id=6864>Sansa</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6865>Tyrion</entity> refuses to force himself on <entity class="NE" id=6866>Sansa</entity> to do his duty , and notes that she is hardly likely to warm to him now that the Lannisters have murdered her mother and brother . <entity class="NE" id=6867>Tyrion</entity> demands to know when <entity class="NE" id=6868>Tywin</entity> ever put the family 's interests above his own . <entity class="NE" id=6869>Tywin</entity> retorts that he did exactly that on the day that <entity class="NE" id=6870>Tyrion</entity> was born : he wanted to throw his newborn son into the sea , but instead he spared him and raised him as his son , because he is a Lannister . Immediately after leaving , <entity class="NE" id=6871>Tyrion</entity> returns to his chambers and calls for <entity class="NE" id=6872>Sansa</entity> , who simply regards him with a forlorn , tear-streaked face confirming that she was already informed of her family 's death . <entity class="NE" id=6873>Tyrion</entity> backs out , knowing that his sympathy would be rather cold comfort . Elsewhere in the <entity class="NE" id=6874>Red Keep</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6875>Varys</entity> meets with <entity class="NE" id=6876>Shae</entity> . He tells her that he knows she is genuinely in love with <entity class="NE" id=6877>Tyrion</entity> - and that is why she should take the diamonds he offers her and leave immediately for <entity class="NE" id=6878>Essos</entity> to build a new , lavish life for herself . <entity class="NE" id=6879>Varys</entity> is convinced that <entity class="NE" id=6880>Tyrion</entity> is the last hope for the <entity class="NE" id=6881>Seven Kingdoms</entity> ' current regime , therefore <entity class="NE" id=6882>Shae</entity> is a weakness that <entity class="NE" id=6880>Tyrion</entity> , and thus the realm , can not afford . <entity class="NE" id=6883>Shae</entity> confirms that she is in love with <entity class="NE" id=6884>Tyrion</entity> and that she cares deeply for <entity class="NE" id=6885>Sansa</entity> as well , but in spite of her pain at seeing them together and the danger she poses , <entity class="NE" id=6883>Shae</entity> will not leave until or unless <entity class="NE" id=6884>Tyrion</entity> asks her to . Unknown to everyone in <entity class="NE" id=6886>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=6887>Jaime Lannister</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6888>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=6889>Tarth</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=6890>Qyburn</entity> finally arrive ; the city folk do not even recognize Jaime after his long absence from the capital . They make their way to the <entity class="NE" id=6891>Red Keep</entity> , where <entity class="NE" id=6892>Jaime</entity> immediately calls on <entity class="NE" id=6893>Cersei</entity> , who regards him with a confused look as she takes in his disheveled appearance and missing hand . At <entity class="NE" id=6894>Dragonstone</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6895>Ser Davos Seaworth</entity> tests his new-found literacy on <entity class="NE" id=6896>Stannis Baratheon</entity> 's correspondence , declining <entity class="NE" id=6897>Shireen Baratheon</entity> 's invitation to read more tales of Aegon I Targaryen . He expresses dissatisfaction about the odd spelling of the word `` night '' , before hearing the horns that signal <entity class="NE" id=6898>Melisandre</entity> 's intents to sacrifice <entity class="NE" id=6899>Gendry</entity> . He argues with <entity class="NE" id=6900>Stannis</entity> again about sacrificing the boy , but <entity class="NE" id=6900>Stannis</entity> is convinced by <entity class="NE" id=6901>Melisandre</entity> that using <entity class="NE" id=6902>Gendry</entity> as part of her blood magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the <entity class="NE" id=6903>Iron Throne</entity> . When he does n't get through to his liege , <entity class="NE" id=6904>Davos</entity> takes matters into his own hands and frees the boy , giving him a rowboat and directions to <entity class="NE" id=6905>King</entity> 's Landing . A furious Stannis sentences <entity class="NE" id=6906>Davos</entity> to death but the <entity class="NE" id=6907>Onion Knight</entity> produces a letter from the <entity class="NE" id=6908>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6909>Davos</entity> insists that it is <entity class="NE" id=6910>Stannis</entity> ' duty to assist the black brothers , and that he will need <entity class="NE" id=6909>Davos</entity> 's assistance to rally troops and mercenaries . <entity class="NE" id=6911>Melisandre</entity> burns the letter and acknowledges the truth : the War of the <entity class="NE" id=6912>Five Kings</entity> is irrelevant . The true war lies in the <entity class="NE" id=6913>North</entity> , and evil and death are marching on the <entity class="NE" id=6914>Wall</entity> . She also agrees that <entity class="NE" id=6915>Davos</entity> has an important role to play in the events to come . <entity class="NE" id=6916>Stannis</entity> sarcastically laughs at <entity class="NE" id=6917>R'hllor</entity> 's sense of humor , noting that the god <entity class="NE" id=6918>Davos</entity> likes to mock has chosen him for a higher purpose . At the <entity class="NE" id=6919>Wall</entity> . Arriving at the abandoned <entity class="NE" id=6920>Nightfort</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6921>Meera Reed</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=6922>Bran</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6923>Hodor</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6924>Jojen</entity> that the castle is safe to enter . While around the fire <entity class="NE" id=6925>Bran</entity> tells the story of the <entity class="NE" id=6926>Rat Cook</entity> , a <entity class="NE" id=6927>Night's Watch</entity> member who killed a guest under his roof , a sin the gods can not forgive . Later that night , <entity class="NE" id=6928>Bran</entity> is awoken by a sound , and wakes his companions in time to see something large climbing out of the castle well ; <entity class="NE" id=6929>Meera</entity> attacks and overpowers the intruder , who is revealed to be <entity class="NE" id=6930>Samwell Tarly</entity> , accompanied by <entity class="NE" id=6931>Gilly</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6932>Sam</entity> quickly deduces <entity class="NE" id=6933>Bran</entity> 's identity by recognizing <entity class="NE" id=6933>Bran</entity> 's direwolf and <entity class="NE" id=6934>Hodor</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6935>Bran</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=6936>Sam</entity> to take him and his group north of the <entity class="NE" id=6937>Wall</entity> , and though <entity class="NE" id=6936>Sam</entity> protests the idea , given the threat of the <entity class="NE" id=6938>White Walkers</entity> and the undead horde they command approaching , he eventually relents and takes them through the passage . Before they separate <entity class="NE" id=6939>Sam</entity> gives the group the rest of his dragonglass supply and tells them that it has the power to kill <entity class="NE" id=6940>White Walkers</entity> . The groups then head in different directions ; <entity class="NE" id=6941>Sam</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6942>Gilly</entity> for <entity class="NE" id=6943>Castle Black</entity> , and the <entity class="NE" id=6944>Reeds</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6945>Hodor</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=6946>Bran</entity> beyond the <entity class="NE" id=6947>Wall</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=6948>Castle Black</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6949>Sam</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6950>Gilly</entity> meet with <entity class="NE" id=6951>Maester Aemon</entity> , who is furious at the prospect of <entity class="NE" id=6949>Sam</entity> having violated his vows . <entity class="NE" id=6952>Sam</entity> defends himself by reciting the <entity class="NE" id=6953>Night's Watch</entity> oath to protect the realms of men whatever side of the Wall they are on and repeating <entity class="NE" id=6954>Jeor Mormont</entity> 's assertion that a wall of ice 500 miles long and 700 feet high was not built to keep out barbarians . <entity class="NE" id=6955>Aemon</entity> 's demeanor softens upon learning that <entity class="NE" id=6956>Gilly</entity> was one of <entity class="NE" id=6957>Craster</entity> 's wives , and acknowledges that she is now a refugee and should be sheltered . <entity class="NE" id=6958>Aemon</entity> then orders <entity class="NE" id=6959>Sam</entity> to begin writing letters immediately and make sure that all forty-four of <entity class="NE" id=6960>Castle Black</entity> 's ravens are well-fed , as every one of them is to fly that night : the <entity class="NE" id=6961>White</entity> Walkers have returned , and <entity class="NE" id=6962>Westeros</entity> must be warned . Stopping to rest and tend to his injuries after fleeing the wildlings , <entity class="NE" id=6963>Jon Snow</entity> finds himself confronted by a furious <entity class="NE" id=6964>Ygritte</entity> , who has an arrow ready to shoot him . <entity class="NE" id=6965>Jon</entity> tries to talk <entity class="NE" id=6966>Ygritte</entity> out of shooting him , insisting that he still loves her but that she should have known his loyalty to the <entity class="NE" id=6967>Watch</entity> was never gone . Though his feelings are clearly reciprocated , <entity class="NE" id=6968>Ygritte</entity> is still angered by his betrayal and shoots Jon three times with her bow as he flees from her , watching him go with tears in her eyes . <entity class="NE" id=6969>Jon</entity> is badly injured , but his horse manages to carry him the rest of the way to <entity class="NE" id=6970>Castle Black</entity> , as he hovers in and out of consciousness . Having reached safety , <entity class="NE" id=6971>Jon</entity> is brought inside the castle by the guards , where he encounters <entity class="NE" id=6972>Sam</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6973>Pypar</entity> , who are overjoyed to see him and insist that his injuries be taken care of . Across the <entity class="NE" id=6974>Narrow Sea</entity> . Outside the walls of <entity class="NE" id=6975>Yunkai</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6976>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> and her advisors wait for the city 's slaves to appear . <entity class="NE" id=6977>Daenerys</entity> frets that the <entity class="NE" id=6978>Yunkish</entity> slaves , who are better treated than <entity class="NE" id=6979>Astapor</entity> 's might have grown to like their chains and will not welcome freedom . Finally , the gates open and the freedmen pour out . <entity class="NE" id=6980>Missandei</entity> begins to tell them of how Daenerys the <entity class="NE" id=6981>Unburnt</entity> freed them , but <entity class="NE" id=6982>Daenerys</entity> interrupts and says that it is the slaves ' own choice to reach for their freedom . After a moment , one of the freedmen stretches his hand towards <entity class="NE" id=6983>Daenerys</entity> and calls out `` mhysa '' . After a moment , another follows suit , then another and another until the entire crowd is chanting `` mhysa '' . <entity class="NE" id=6984>Bewildered</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6985>Daenerys</entity> turns to <entity class="NE" id=6986>Missandei</entity> , who reveals that the word means `` mother '' in the <entity class="NE" id=6987>Old Ghiscari</entity> language . When the slaves advance on <entity class="NE" id=6988>Daenerys</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=6989>Unsullied</entity> step into formation , but the queen tells them to stand down . Telling her dragons to fly , <entity class="NE" id=6990>Daenerys</entity> steps out of the protection of the <entity class="NE" id=6991>Unsullied</entity> and into the crowd , who carry on their chanting . <entity class="NE" id=6992>Daenerys</entity> is embraced by the former slaves , offering a glimmer of hope in an increasingly darker and hopeless world .
