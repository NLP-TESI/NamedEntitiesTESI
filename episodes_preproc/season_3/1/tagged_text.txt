<entity class="NE" id=3762>Jon</entity> is brought before <entity class="NE" id=3763>Mance Rayder</entity> , the King Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=3764>Wall</entity> , while the <entity class="NE" id=3765>Night's Watch</entity> survivors retreat south . In <entity class="NE" id=3766>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=3767>Tyrion</entity> asks for his reward , <entity class="NE" id=3768>Littlefinger</entity> offers <entity class="NE" id=3769>Sansa</entity> a way out , and <entity class="NE" id=3770>Cersei</entity> hosts a dinner for the royal family . <entity class="NE" id=3771>Dany</entity> sails into <entity class="NE" id=3772>Slaver</entity> 's Bay . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=3773>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3774>Ghost</entity> attacks a wight . In a prologue scene , shouts and sword clashes are heard in the darkness as the <entity class="NE" id=3775>White Walkers</entity> and their army of undead wights attack the men of the <entity class="NE" id=3776>Night's Watch</entity> off-screen in the <entity class="NE" id=3777>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3778>Fist</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3779>First Men</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3780>Samwell Samwell</entity> is then seen alive , wandering through a blizzard in search of safety . He sees another man of the <entity class="NE" id=3781>Night's Watch</entity> up ahead but soon finds that he has been decapitated and his head placed in his own hands . Just then , a wight approaches <entity class="NE" id=3782>Sam</entity> and is about to attack him with an axe when the direwolf <entity class="NE" id=3783>Ghost</entity> knocks it down . <entity class="NE" id=3784>Ghost</entity> continues to tear at its legs as it pulls itself forward inch by inch towards <entity class="NE" id=3785>Sam</entity> . The wight suddenly burst into flame , destroyed by a torch wielded by <entity class="NE" id=3786>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entity> , killing it . <entity class="NE" id=3787>Mormont</entity> has managed to rally the few dozen survivors out of his original three hundred men at the <entity class="NE" id=3788>Fist</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3789>First Men</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3790>Mormont</entity> is angry that <entity class="NE" id=3791>Sam</entity> was n't able to send off any messenger-ravens in the confusion of the attack . <entity class="NE" id=3792>Mormont</entity> announces that they must retreat back to the <entity class="NE" id=3793>Wall</entity> , not simply to save their own lives but because <entity class="NE" id=3794>Castle Black</entity> and the rest of <entity class="NE" id=3795>Westeros</entity> must be warned of the coming threat―otherwise everyone they 've ever known will die . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=3796>Jon Snow</entity> is led by <entity class="NE" id=3797>Ygritte</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=3798>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=3799>Bones</entity> into the main wildling camp in the <entity class="NE" id=3800>Frostfangs</entity> mountains . It is not simply an army camp - almost all of wildling society is on the move to escape the <entity class="NE" id=3801>White Walkers</entity> , including women and children . As they enter the camp , <entity class="NE" id=3802>Jon</entity> is shocked to see a real-life giant walk past . Many of the wildlings are surprised to see <entity class="NE" id=3803>Jon</entity> in his all-black <entity class="NE" id=3804>Night's Watch</entity> clothing and shout `` Crow ! '' at his approach . Several young boys pelt <entity class="NE" id=3805>Jon</entity> with ice and small stones , but <entity class="NE" id=3806>Ygritte</entity> shoos them away . Giant carrying mammoth bones . <entity class="NE" id=3807>Jon</entity> is led into the tent of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder , where the <entity class="NE" id=3808>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=3809>Bones</entity> explains that he is <entity class="NE" id=3810>Ned Stark</entity> 's bastard son to a large man with a heavy beard who is eating chicken by the fire . He says that he does n't care , but his interest is piqued on hearing that <entity class="NE" id=3811>Jon</entity> killed <entity class="NE" id=3812>Qhorin Halfhand</entity> . As they talk , <entity class="NE" id=3813>Jon</entity> kneels before the man , whom he assumes to be <entity class="NE" id=3814>Mance Rayder</entity> , and calls him `` Your Grace '' as he would a king south of the <entity class="NE" id=3815>Wall</entity> . All the wildlings to burst into laughter ; their society does not bother with such ceremony–and because the man actually is n't <entity class="NE" id=3816>Mance</entity> , but his lieutenant <entity class="NE" id=3817>Tormund Giantsbane</entity> . Mance himself is an unassuming man sitting in a corner , who then introduces himself and tells <entity class="NE" id=3818>Jon</entity> to stand , as no man kneels before another among the <entity class="NE" id=3819>Free Folk</entity> , as they do not recognize a class of nobility in their culture . <entity class="NE" id=3820>Mance</entity> says he is glad that <entity class="NE" id=3821>Jon</entity> killed <entity class="NE" id=3822>Qhorin</entity> , as he had killed many of <entity class="NE" id=3820>Mance</entity> 's wildlings , though he notes that <entity class="NE" id=3822>Qhorin</entity> was his brother once , back when he was a member of the <entity class="NE" id=3823>Night's Watch</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3822>Qhorin</entity> had a whole hand . <entity class="NE" id=3824>Mance</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=3825>Jon</entity> why he wants to join them . He replies that he wants to be free , but <entity class="NE" id=3826>Mance</entity> thinks he just wants to be a hero . <entity class="NE" id=3827>Jon</entity> then explains that when the <entity class="NE" id=3828>Night's Watch</entity> camped at <entity class="NE" id=3829>Craster</entity> 's Keep , he saw <entity class="NE" id=3829>Craster</entity> leave his newborn son in the woods as an offering , and the inhuman creature that took it . <entity class="NE" id=3830>Jon</entity> says that he wants to leave the <entity class="NE" id=3831>Night's Watch</entity> because he is disgusted that <entity class="NE" id=3832>Mormont</entity> already knew what <entity class="NE" id=3833>Craster</entity> was doing but did nothing to stop it . <entity class="NE" id=3834>Jon</entity> states that the <entity class="NE" id=3835>First Men</entity> he is descended from defeated the <entity class="NE" id=3836>White Walkers</entity> once during The <entity class="NE" id=3837>Long Night</entity> , and that now he wants `` to fight for the side who fights for the living . '' <entity class="NE" id=3838>Mance</entity> is satisfied and advises <entity class="NE" id=3839>Jon</entity> to get a new cloak . In the <entity class="NE" id=3840>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3841>Bronn</entity> confronts two Kingsguard . In <entity class="NE" id=3842>King</entity> 's Landing , King <entity class="NE" id=3843>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> 's forces stand victorious after the <entity class="NE" id=3844>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3845>Blackwater</entity> . <entity class="HSE" id=3846>House House</entity> 's new allies <entity class="HSE" id=3847>House Tyrell</entity> begin to settle into the capital . <entity class="NE" id=3848>Tywin Lannister</entity> bluntly tells his son Tyrion that he intends to disinherit him . This comes as a shock , because his older brother <entity class="NE" id=3849>Jaime</entity> gave up all right to inherit his father 's lands when he joined the <entity class="NE" id=3850>Kingsguard</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=3851>Tyrion</entity> is rightfully the next in line of succession . For that matter , despite all evidence to the contrary , <entity class="NE" id=3852>Tywin</entity> refuses to believe that <entity class="NE" id=3853>Tyrion</entity> was in any way helpful in the defense of the city or during his months as acting <entity class="NE" id=3854>Hand</entity> of the King . Instead , <entity class="NE" id=3855>Tywin</entity> obstinately maintains his belief that Tyrion is a whore-mongering , drunken , `` ill-made , spiteful little creature , '' and that he is lying about all of his accomplishments out of envy . <entity class="NE" id=3856>Tywin</entity> is particularly insulted that <entity class="NE" id=3857>Tyrion</entity> brought his mistress , <entity class="NE" id=3858>Shae</entity> , to the capital when <entity class="NE" id=3856>Tywin</entity> explicitly told him not to , which makes <entity class="NE" id=3856>Tywin</entity> convince himself that <entity class="NE" id=3857>Tyrion</entity> was in bed with <entity class="NE" id=3858>Shae</entity> most of the time while events spiraled out of control . When <entity class="NE" id=3859>Tyrion</entity> asks why his father is doing this , <entity class="NE" id=3860>Tywin</entity> is shocked as if <entity class="NE" id=3859>Tyrion</entity> insulted him , and says it should be obvious as <entity class="NE" id=3859>Tyrion</entity> `` killed '' his mother <entity class="NE" id=3861>Joanna</entity> in childbirth so that he might enter the world . <entity class="NE" id=3862>Tywin</entity> says that the laws of men say he has to let <entity class="NE" id=3863>Tyrion</entity> use his family name , but that he wishes he could prove <entity class="NE" id=3863>Tyrion</entity> was n't his son , so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the name `` Lannister '' which he stole from <entity class="NE" id=3862>Tywin</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3864>Tyrion</entity> fumes at the situation to his sellsword <entity class="NE" id=3865>Bronn</entity> , who has recently been knighted as a reward for his service in the <entity class="NE" id=3866>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3867>Blackwater</entity> . He now styles himself as `` <entity class="NE" id=3868>Ser Bronn</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3869>Blackwater</entity> , '' and while possessing no lands , wealth , or title , this drastically elevates his social standing–and in his mind , his pay . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=3870>Joffrey</entity> 's ride back from the <entity class="NE" id=3871>Great Sept</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=3872>Baelor</entity> in a heavily guarded palanquin is interrupted when his betrothed , <entity class="NE" id=3873>Lady Margaery Tyrell</entity> , stops the procession in <entity class="NE" id=3874>Flea Bottom</entity> unexpectedly . <entity class="NE" id=3875>Margaery</entity> shocks the guards and bewilders <entity class="NE" id=3876>Joffrey</entity> by getting out and exploring , eventually arriving at an orphanage and interacting with the children . Meanwhile , her servants pass out bread and toys , earning her the love of <entity class="NE" id=3877>Flea Bottom</entity> 's smallfolk . That evening , <entity class="NE" id=3878>Joffrey</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3879>Cersei</entity> visit <entity class="NE" id=3880>Margaery</entity> and her brother <entity class="NE" id=3881>Loras Tyrell</entity> for a small dinner party . <entity class="NE" id=3882>Cersei</entity> admonishes <entity class="NE" id=3883>Margaery</entity> 's boldness and reminds her that her impromptu charity work took place on the same streets where the royal party was assaulted weeks earlier . When <entity class="NE" id=3884>Joffrey</entity> naively defends <entity class="NE" id=3885>Margaery</entity> and criticizes his mother , <entity class="NE" id=3886>Cersei</entity> realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered . <entity class="NE" id=3887>Cersei</entity> only knows how to rule through fear , but <entity class="NE" id=3888>Margaery</entity> knows how to win the love of the people she rules over , a skill <entity class="NE" id=3887>Cersei</entity> lacks . <entity class="NE" id=3889>Sansa Sansa</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3890>Shae</entity> sit on the docks watching ships arrive and depart . <entity class="NE" id=3891>Sansa</entity> wants to play a game making up stories about where the ships are headed , but <entity class="NE" id=3892>Shae</entity> , in typical fashion , is uninterested . <entity class="NE" id=3893>Petyr Petyr</entity> arrives to speak with <entity class="NE" id=3894>Sansa</entity> . She displays an eagerness to leave as soon as possible . He suggests that when he next leaves the capital by sea , she might be able to stow away . <entity class="NE" id=3895>Sansa</entity> advises him not to give her too many details since she is a terrible liar . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=3896>Ros</entity> , who seems to be acting as <entity class="NE" id=3897>Littlefinger</entity> 's aide , reminisces about the day <entity class="NE" id=3898>Sansa</entity> was born , when all the bells in <entity class="NE" id=3899>Winterfell</entity> were rung in celebration . She asks <entity class="NE" id=3900>Shae</entity> to look out for <entity class="NE" id=3901>Sansa</entity> , particularly in regards to <entity class="NE" id=3902>Littlefinger</entity> . On <entity class="NE" id=3903>Dragonstone</entity> , King <entity class="NE" id=3904>Stannis Baratheon</entity> 's shattered forces regroup after being almost totally destroyed in the <entity class="NE" id=3905>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3906>Blackwater</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3907>Davos Davos</entity> is rescued from the sea by <entity class="NE" id=3908>Salladhor Saan</entity> after being thrown overboard by the wildfire blast in the battle . Forlorn over the death of his son <entity class="NE" id=3909>Matthos</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3910>Davos</entity> feels that <entity class="NE" id=3911>Melisandre</entity> has led <entity class="NE" id=3912>Stannis</entity> to disaster , and is horrified to hear from <entity class="NE" id=3913>Salladhor</entity> that she has begun to conduct human sacrifices . After the defeated remnant of <entity class="NE" id=3914>Stannis</entity> ' forces returned to the island , <entity class="NE" id=3915>Melisandre</entity> ordered any who spoke out against her to be burned alive as offerings to the <entity class="NE" id=3916>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=3917>Light</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3918>Davos</entity> convinces <entity class="NE" id=3919>Salladhor</entity> to bring him to <entity class="NE" id=3920>Dragonstone</entity> . He finds <entity class="NE" id=3921>Stannis</entity> despondent , sitting in the Chamber of the <entity class="NE" id=3922>Painted Table</entity> alone with <entity class="NE" id=3923>Melisandre</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3924>Davos</entity> openly calls Melisandre his enemy , condemns her for conducting human sacrifices , and says she is leading <entity class="NE" id=3925>Stannis</entity> astray . She counters that it was <entity class="NE" id=3926>Davos</entity> who urged <entity class="NE" id=3927>Stannis</entity> not to bring her to the battle , and implies that it was actually <entity class="NE" id=3926>Davos</entity> ' fault that thousands of their men burned to death , including his own son . At the mention of his son <entity class="NE" id=3928>Davos</entity> draws a knife on her in a fit of anger , but he is restrained by the guards , and <entity class="NE" id=3929>Stannis</entity> orders him put in the dungeon . <entity class="NE" id=3930>Davos</entity> tries to kill <entity class="NE" id=3931>Melisandre</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=3932>Riverlands</entity> , the morale of King <entity class="NE" id=3933>Robb Stark</entity> 's army is starting to wane . They have not had a significant victory since the <entity class="NE" id=3934>Battle</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=3935>Oxcross</entity> months ago , and the news of the <entity class="NE" id=3936>Lannisters</entity> ' victory over <entity class="NE" id=3937>Stannis</entity> and new alliance with the <entity class="NE" id=3938>Tyrells</entity> piles bad news upon bad news . <entity class="NE" id=3939>Robb</entity> has won every battle he has ever fought , but the <entity class="NE" id=3940>Lannisters</entity> finally realized it was too difficult to try to attack him head-on , so they have shifted to the new strategy of simply fleeing ahead of <entity class="NE" id=3939>Robb</entity> 's army . <entity class="NE" id=3941>Robb</entity> 's forces have won many small but also insignificant minor victories , as the Lannisters are now determined to simply wait <entity class="NE" id=3941>Robb</entity> out and exhaust his army far from home while they slowly rebuild their own numbers and gain new allies . In frustration , <entity class="NE" id=3942>Robb</entity> launches a new offensive to the east which takes the great castle of <entity class="NE" id=3943>Harrenhal</entity> , which <entity class="NE" id=3944>Tywin</entity> had been using it as the main Lannister forward base in the <entity class="NE" id=3945>Riverlands</entity> during the first year of the war . However , <entity class="NE" id=3946>Robb</entity> does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for : <entity class="NE" id=3947>Tywin</entity> withdrew his garrison to <entity class="NE" id=3948>King</entity> 's Landing to counter the attack by <entity class="NE" id=3949>Stannis</entity> , and did n't even bother wasting any men on a token defense of the castle . <entity class="NE" id=3950>Robb</entity> and his forces are further demoralized to find that the <entity class="NE" id=3951>Lannisters</entity> massacred two hundred <entity class="NE" id=3952>Northern</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3953>Riverlands</entity> prisoners of war before they left , and the courtyards are choked with piles of bodies . They do find one survivor , a maester named <entity class="NE" id=3954>Qyburn</entity> . Across the <entity class="NE" id=3955>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3956>Drogon</entity> roasts a fish . <entity class="NE" id=3957>Daenerys Daenerys</entity> 's ship arrives at the city of <entity class="NE" id=3958>Astapor</entity> in <entity class="NE" id=3959>Slaver</entity> 's Bay after leaving <entity class="NE" id=3960>Qarth</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3961>Daenerys</entity> ' dragons are continuing to grow , and are now about the size of small dogs . They fly about their ship as it approaches the city , plucking fish from the sea and roasting them in mid-air with their fire-breath.She notes that they are still not big enough to use as weapons of war to invade <entity class="NE" id=3962>Westeros</entity> with , and that she needs an army . Ser Ser notes that the elite warrior-eunuchs produced in <entity class="NE" id=3963>Astapor</entity> , known as the <entity class="NE" id=3964>Unsullied</entity> , are said to be among the finest soldiers in the world . <entity class="NE" id=3965>Daenerys</entity> stresses that they are slave-soldiers , a distinction which may make some look on her negatively in <entity class="NE" id=3966>Westeros</entity> where slavery is illegal , but <entity class="NE" id=3967>Jorah</entity> says they have no better ideas for how to acquire an army . <entity class="NE" id=3968>Daenerys</entity> expresses interest in expanding her tiny Dothraki khalasar ( most of them are seasick because the <entity class="NE" id=3969>Dothraki</entity> have never traveled on ships before ) , but <entity class="NE" id=3970>Jorah</entity> says that other <entity class="NE" id=3969>Dothraki</entity> will only join her if they think she is strong , and for that she needs an army . Upon arriving at <entity class="NE" id=3971>Astapor</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3972>Daenerys</entity> is given a tour of the <entity class="NE" id=3973>Unsullied</entity> barracks by the <entity class="NE" id=3973>Unsullied</entity> 's owner , <entity class="NE" id=3974>Kraznys mo Nakloz</entity> , with his slave girl Missandei translating his <entity class="NE" id=3975>Low Valyrian</entity> into the <entity class="NE" id=3976>Common Tongue</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=3977>Westeros</entity> for <entity class="NE" id=3972>Daenerys</entity> . They explain that the Unsullied are trained for battle from the age of five , and that only one in four recruits survives the training . <entity class="NE" id=3978>Kraznys</entity> also demonstrates that the Unsullied do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier ( much to <entity class="NE" id=3979>Daenerys</entity> 's disgust ) , who not only shows no sign of pain , but thanks the slavemaster for the opportunity to serve him . <entity class="NE" id=3980>Kraznys</entity> goes on to explain that the Unsullied are trained to show no mercy or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its mother at the end of their training . <entity class="NE" id=3981>Daenerys</entity> is outraged by this , but still asks how many Unsullied are available . She is told there are eight thousand soldiers for sale and that she has until the next day to make a decision . <entity class="NE" id=3982>En</entity> route back to their ship , <entity class="NE" id=3983>Ser Jorah</entity> urges that <entity class="NE" id=3984>Daenerys</entity> should purchase the <entity class="NE" id=3985>Unsullied</entity> , arguing that under her command , these slave soldiers will have a far better quality of life serving her than they would under <entity class="NE" id=3986>Kraznys</entity> and his ilk . <entity class="NE" id=3987>Daenerys</entity> is distracted by a playing child following her and <entity class="NE" id=3988>Jorah</entity> , and neither notice a man in a hooded black cloak following them , armed with a dagger . <entity class="NE" id=3989>Barristan</entity> saves Daenerys from a deadly manticore . The child offers a gift to <entity class="NE" id=3990>Daenerys</entity> - a wooden ball - but as she picks it up , the hooded stranger knocks it out of her hands ; <entity class="NE" id=3991>Ser Jorah</entity> grabs the stranger and their struggle knocks <entity class="NE" id=3990>Daenerys</entity> to the ground , where to her horror , the ball cracks in half and a manticore emerges to attack . Before the creature can harm <entity class="NE" id=3992>Daenerys</entity> with its lethal sting , the stranger impales it with his dagger and charges at the child , who hisses in a reptilian manner , baring teeth and features reminiscent of <entity class="NE" id=3993>Pyat Pree</entity> , and uses magic to escape . <entity class="NE" id=3994>Daenerys</entity> realizes the assassin was likely an agent of the surviving <entity class="NE" id=3995>Warlocks</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=3996>Qarth</entity> . Turning her attention to her savior , <entity class="NE" id=3997>Daenerys</entity> is surprised when the man addresses her as his Queen and removes his hood . She asks if <entity class="NE" id=3998>Jorah</entity> knows the man . A stunned <entity class="NE" id=3999>Jorah</entity> admits he does ; the stranger before them is one of the most skilled fighters in <entity class="NE" id=4000>Westeros</entity> : <entity class="NE" id=4001>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4002>Lord Commander</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4003>Robert Baratheon</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=4004>Kingsguard</entity> . Falling to his knees , <entity class="NE" id=4005>Ser Barristan</entity> explains that following <entity class="NE" id=4006>Robert</entity> 's death and his dismissal by <entity class="NE" id=4007>Joffrey</entity> , he has been searching for <entity class="NE" id=4008>Daenerys Stormborn</entity> , to beg her forgiveness and offer his service , hoping to make amends for failing <entity class="HSE" id=4009>House Targaryen</entity> during and after <entity class="NE" id=4006>Robert</entity> 's Rebellion , when he served in her father 's <entity class="NE" id=4010>Kingsguard</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4011>Barristan</entity> hails her as the rightful <entity class="NE" id=4012>Queen</entity> and asks to serve in her Queensguard .
