<entity class="NE" id=5839>Tywin</entity> plans strategic unions for the <entity class="NE" id=5840>Lannisters</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5841>Melisandre</entity> pays a visit to the <entity class="NE" id=5842>Riverlands</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5843>Robb</entity> weighs a compromise to repair his alliance with <entity class="HSE" id=5844>House Frey</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5845>Roose Roose</entity> decides what to do with <entity class="NE" id=5846>Jaime Lannister</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5847>Jon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5848>Ygritte</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=5849>Wildlings</entity> face a daunting climb . In the <entity class="NE" id=5850>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=5851>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=5852>Lord Tywin Lannister</entity> meets with <entity class="NE" id=5853>Lady Olenna Tyrell</entity> to discuss having <entity class="NE" id=5854>Ser Loras</entity> marry his daughter , <entity class="NE" id=5855>Cersei</entity> . They trade barbs about <entity class="NE" id=5856>Cersei</entity> 's age , <entity class="NE" id=5856>Cersei</entity> 's capability to have more children , and accusations of incest with <entity class="NE" id=5857>Jaime</entity> , as well as <entity class="NE" id=5858>Loras</entity> 's well-known homosexuality . <entity class="NE" id=5859>Tywin</entity> is adamant that <entity class="NE" id=5860>Cersei</entity> , whom he calls the <entity class="NE" id=5861>Kingdom</entity> 's most beautiful woman , should marry <entity class="NE" id=5862>Loras</entity> , the <entity class="NE" id=5861>Kingdom</entity> 's most handsome and desired bachelor , but <entity class="NE" id=5863>Olenna</entity> blatantly refuses to consent , hinting that <entity class="NE" id=5864>Joffrey</entity> is the result of incest . <entity class="NE" id=5865>Tywin</entity> replies that if that is true , he has no right to the throne and the <entity class="NE" id=5866>Tyrells</entity> just `` threw a flower into the dirt '' . <entity class="NE" id=5867>Olenna</entity> says she will not risk `` throwing another flower into the dirt '' if <entity class="NE" id=5868>Cersei</entity> can not bear heirs for the <entity class="NE" id=5869>Tyrells</entity> . Realizing her unchanged position on the matter , <entity class="NE" id=5870>Tywin</entity> threatens to make Loras a knight of the <entity class="NE" id=5871>Kingsguard</entity> , which would force <entity class="NE" id=5872>Loras</entity> to give up his right to marriage and to inherit <entity class="NE" id=5873>Highgarden</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5874>Olenna</entity> relents , and consents to the marriage of <entity class="NE" id=5875>Loras</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5876>Cersei</entity> . In the gardens , <entity class="NE" id=5877>Sansa Stark</entity> tries to get closer to Loras by discussing their hopefully impending wedding . <entity class="NE" id=5878>Loras</entity> is clearly uncomfortable being so close to her , but brightens when discussing the lavish wedding he 's had planned â€“ although <entity class="NE" id=5879>Sansa</entity> , for once , becomes suspicious when she realizes that <entity class="NE" id=5878>Loras</entity> seems more excited by the food and the wedding joust than by her . <entity class="NE" id=5880>Loras</entity> quickly placates her with a compliment and then describes the wedding gown he 's envisioned for her . <entity class="NE" id=5881>Sansa</entity> says she 's looking forward to seeing <entity class="NE" id=5882>Highgarden</entity> , as she 's only ever lived in <entity class="NE" id=5883>Winterfell</entity> and ca n't wait to leave King 's Landing . In this , <entity class="NE" id=5884>Loras</entity> finds unexpected common ground with her and agrees that the <entity class="NE" id=5885>Red Keep</entity> is `` the most terrible place there is '' . <entity class="NE" id=5886>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5887>Tyrion Lannister</entity> observe the couple from <entity class="NE" id=5886>Cersei</entity> 's chambers overlooking the garden . <entity class="NE" id=5888>Tyrion</entity> sarcastically asks which of the four of them has it the worst . He then finally accuses his sister of trying to have him killed during the <entity class="NE" id=5889>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=5890>Blackwater</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5891>Cersei</entity> , tired of fighting him , remains quiet while he deduces that only two people can command the <entity class="NE" id=5892>Kingsguard</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5893>Tyrion</entity> realizes that while <entity class="NE" id=5894>Cersei</entity> certainly has the authority to command a <entity class="NE" id=5895>Kingsguard</entity> , she is n't stupid enough to command <entity class="NE" id=5896>Ser Mandon Moore</entity> to kill him in public . <entity class="NE" id=5897>Tyrion</entity> realizes that it was in fact Joffrey who ordered <entity class="NE" id=5898>Ser Mandon Moore</entity> to kill him , because <entity class="NE" id=5897>Tyrion</entity> was the only one who stood up to him . <entity class="NE" id=5899>Cersei</entity> tells him his life is not in danger from <entity class="NE" id=5900>Joffrey</entity> , as he dare not try anything like that now that <entity class="NE" id=5901>Tywin</entity> is the <entity class="NE" id=5902>Hand</entity> . They discuss about <entity class="NE" id=5903>Jaime</entity> 's possible return to <entity class="NE" id=5904>King</entity> 's Landing , with <entity class="NE" id=5905>Cersei</entity> wondering where he could possibly be . She asks <entity class="NE" id=5906>Tyrion</entity> which one of them should be the one to break the news to <entity class="NE" id=5907>Sansa</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5908>Tyrion</entity> decides he might as well dash <entity class="NE" id=5909>Sansa</entity> 's hopes sooner rather than later . He goes to <entity class="NE" id=5910>Sansa</entity> 's chamber and asks for a private word , but <entity class="NE" id=5910>Sansa</entity> declines to dismiss <entity class="NE" id=5911>Shae</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5912>Tyrion</entity> gives <entity class="NE" id=5913>Shae</entity> a carefully coded apology for not telling her in private before breaking the news to <entity class="NE" id=5914>Sansa</entity> . Later on , <entity class="NE" id=5915>Lord Varys</entity> finds <entity class="NE" id=5916>Lord Petyr Baelish</entity> in the throne room . <entity class="NE" id=5917>Varys</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5918>Baelish</entity> discuss the <entity class="NE" id=5919>Iron Throne</entity> and the pageantry and propaganda that creates nations and cements dynasties . <entity class="NE" id=5920>Varys</entity> asserts that he serves the realm , but <entity class="NE" id=5921>Baelish</entity> scoffs that `` the realm '' is an invention of Aegon the <entity class="NE" id=5922>Conqueror</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5923>Baelish</entity> tells Varys that he is aware of <entity class="NE" id=5924>Varys</entity> ' arrangement with <entity class="NE" id=5925>Ros</entity> , and that he has given her to `` a friend '' who is eager for a new experience . <entity class="NE" id=5926>Baelish</entity> revels in the chaos that he has caused , likening chaos to a ladder ( for those brave enough to climb ) rather than a pit to be lost in , as <entity class="NE" id=5927>Varys</entity> and everyone else sees it . <entity class="NE" id=5928>Joffrey</entity> kills <entity class="NE" id=5929>Ros</entity> . Elsewhere , <entity class="NE" id=5930>Sansa</entity> weeps as <entity class="NE" id=5931>Baelish</entity> 's ship departs , both of her plans to leave King 's Landing in tatters . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=5932>Joffrey</entity> coldly contemplates <entity class="NE" id=5933>Ros</entity> 's quarrel-ridden corpse . In the <entity class="NE" id=5934>Riverlands</entity> , the hideout of the <entity class="NE" id=5935>Brotherhood</entity> without <entity class="NE" id=5936>Banners</entity> outside of <entity class="NE" id=5937>Hollow Hill</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5938>Anguy</entity> trains <entity class="NE" id=5939>Arya Stark</entity> with a bow . <entity class="NE" id=5940>Anguy</entity> teaching <entity class="NE" id=5941>Arya</entity> how to shoot a bow better . <entity class="NE" id=5942>Arya</entity> spots someone behind her target , which is revealed to be <entity class="NE" id=5943>Melisandre</entity> and a small group of <entity class="NE" id=5944>Stannis Baratheon</entity> 's men . She speaks to Thoros in <entity class="NE" id=5945>High Valyrian</entity> , demanding to know what became of his mission to convert <entity class="NE" id=5946>Robert Baratheon</entity> to the worship of the <entity class="NE" id=5947>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5948>Light</entity> . He bluntly tells her he failed . <entity class="NE" id=5949>Melisandre</entity> is brought to the <entity class="NE" id=5950>Brotherhood</entity> 's hideout and is shocked when she learns of the six deaths of <entity class="NE" id=5951>Beric Dondarrion</entity> , exclaiming that <entity class="NE" id=5952>Thoros</entity> should not have that kind of power . <entity class="NE" id=5953>Thoros</entity> counters that he has no power , he only asks for favors and the <entity class="NE" id=5954>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5955>Light</entity> sees fit to grant them . The priestess seems troubled by his response ( or perhaps by the fact that the <entity class="NE" id=5956>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5957>Light</entity> looks favorably on causes other than her own ) . <entity class="NE" id=5958>Melisandre</entity> says the <entity class="NE" id=5959>Brotherhood</entity> has someone the <entity class="NE" id=5960>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5961>Light</entity> needs , and soon after has her men take <entity class="NE" id=5962>Gendry</entity> into her custody . <entity class="NE" id=5963>Arya</entity> protests , particularly when she sees that <entity class="NE" id=5964>Melisandre</entity> has given the <entity class="NE" id=5965>Brotherhood</entity> two heavy sacks of gold in exchange . She confronts the red priestess , calling her a witch . <entity class="NE" id=5966>Melisandre</entity> ignores the barb and looks into <entity class="NE" id=5967>Arya</entity> 's eyes . She sees many other eyes , of many other colors- eyes that <entity class="NE" id=5968>Arya</entity> will shut forever . <entity class="NE" id=5969>Melisandre</entity> abruptly tells her that they will meet again . <entity class="NE" id=5970>Edmure</entity> is enraged at having to marry <entity class="NE" id=5971>Roslin</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=5972>Riverrun</entity> , King <entity class="NE" id=5973>Robb Stark</entity> and his advisors meet with `` <entity class="NE" id=5974>Black Walder</entity> '' and <entity class="NE" id=5975>Lothar Frey</entity> to discuss an alliance for his planned attack on Casterly Rock . The <entity class="NE" id=5976>Freys</entity> carry <entity class="NE" id=5977>Walder Frey</entity> 's demands for an alliance , which includes a formal apology from <entity class="NE" id=5978>Robb</entity> , the castle <entity class="NE" id=5979>Harrenhal</entity> and all of its lands and incomes , and for <entity class="NE" id=5980>Edmure Tully</entity> to marry <entity class="NE" id=5981>Roslin</entity> , one of his daughters . <entity class="NE" id=5982>Edmure</entity> is reluctant to marry a woman he has never met , but is eventually convinced by the group to go through with the arrangement . <entity class="NE" id=5983>Jaime</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5984>Bolton</entity> discuss <entity class="NE" id=5983>Jaime</entity> 's release . At <entity class="NE" id=5985>Harrenhal</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5986>Lord Roose Bolton</entity> has dinner with <entity class="NE" id=5987>Jaime</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5988>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5989>Tarth</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5990>Bolton</entity> tells Jaime he will send him to <entity class="NE" id=5991>King</entity> 's Landing as restitution for his lost hand but only on the condition that Jaime swear to tell his father that <entity class="NE" id=5990>Bolton</entity> was not personally responsible for maiming him . <entity class="NE" id=5992>Jaime</entity> assumes that <entity class="NE" id=5993>Brienne</entity> will accompany him , but <entity class="NE" id=5994>Bolton</entity> intends to keep her with him , under arrest for abetting treason . In the <entity class="NE" id=5995>North</entity> , tensions rise at camp between <entity class="NE" id=5996>Osha</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5997>Meera Reed</entity> before <entity class="NE" id=5998>Bran Stark</entity> diffuses the situation . <entity class="NE" id=5999>Jojen Jojen</entity> experiences a seizure while sleeping , and <entity class="NE" id=6000>Meera</entity> explains they are caused by his visions . <entity class="NE" id=6001>Jojen</entity> then tells <entity class="NE" id=6002>Bran</entity> that in his vision he saw <entity class="NE" id=6003>Jon Snow</entity> with the wildlings . <entity class="NE" id=6004>Theon</entity> is tortured Elsewhere , the cleaning boy awakens <entity class="NE" id=6005>Theon Greyjoy</entity> to continue torturing him . The boy threatens to remove <entity class="NE" id=6006>Theon</entity> 's pinky finger if he can not guess the boy 's true identity and their current location . He gives the impression that <entity class="NE" id=6007>Theon</entity> guessed right when <entity class="NE" id=6007>Theon</entity> says he is the younger brother of <entity class="NE" id=6008>Torrhen Karstark</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6009>Rickard Karstark's</entity> son , and that they are in <entity class="NE" id=6010>Karhold</entity> . But then , the boy tells Theon he was lying , and begins flaying <entity class="NE" id=6011>Theon</entity> 's finger while telling him that he is torturing Theon only for his own amusement . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=6012>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6013>Samwell Samwell</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6014>Gilly</entity> stop to camp during their journey to The Wall after having fled <entity class="NE" id=6015>Craster</entity> 's Keep . <entity class="NE" id=6016>Sam</entity> shows Gilly the <entity class="NE" id=6017>Dragonglass</entity> dagger he found at the <entity class="NE" id=6018>Fist</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=6019>First Men</entity> and tells her about <entity class="NE" id=6020>Castle Black</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6021>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6022>Ygritte</entity> kissing on the top of the wall . At camp at the base of the <entity class="NE" id=6023>Wall</entity> , the wildling party led by <entity class="NE" id=6024>Tormund Giantsbane</entity> prepare to climb . <entity class="NE" id=6025>Jon Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6026>Ygritte</entity> talk about their impending climb and their relationship . <entity class="NE" id=6027>Ygritte</entity> reveals she is aware that <entity class="NE" id=6028>Jon</entity> is still loyal to the <entity class="NE" id=6029>Night's Watch</entity> , but tells him he must be loyal to each other instead . While climbing , <entity class="NE" id=6030>Ygritte</entity> strikes the <entity class="NE" id=6031>Wall</entity> and causes a massive crack , which dislodges a large sheet of ice , sending several wildlings to their deaths . <entity class="NE" id=6032>Ygritte</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6033>Jon</entity> hang precariously by their safety rope . <entity class="NE" id=6034>Orell</entity> decides that <entity class="NE" id=6035>Tormund</entity> can not continue climbing with the weight of <entity class="NE" id=6036>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6037>Ygritte</entity> 's bodies pulling them down and begins cutting the rope . <entity class="NE" id=6038>Jon</entity> sees what <entity class="NE" id=6039>Orell</entity> is doing and barely manages to swing to his left and plant a hook in the ice , saving himself and <entity class="NE" id=6040>Ygritte</entity> . They reach the top of the wall , and <entity class="NE" id=6041>Ygritte</entity> is awed by the view beyond the wall and to the south , before she and <entity class="NE" id=6042>Jon</entity> share a passionate kiss .
