<entity id=5869>Tywin</entity> plans strategic unions for the <entity id=5870>Lannisters</entity> . <entity id=5871>Melisandre</entity> pays a visit to the <entity id=5872>Riverlands</entity> . <entity id=5873>Robb</entity> weighs a compromise to repair his alliance with <entity id=5874>House Frey</entity> . <entity id=5875>Roose Roose</entity> decides what to do with <entity id=5876>Jaime Lannister</entity> . <entity id=5877>Jon</entity> , <entity id=5878>Ygritte</entity> and the <entity id=5879>Wildlings</entity> face a daunting climb . In the <entity id=5880>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . In <entity id=5881>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity id=5882>Lord Tywin Lannister</entity> meets with <entity id=5883>Lady Olenna Tyrell</entity> to discuss having <entity id=5884>Ser Loras</entity> marry his daughter , <entity id=5885>Cersei</entity> . They trade barbs about <entity id=5886>Cersei</entity> 's age , <entity id=5886>Cersei</entity> 's capability to have more children , and accusations of incest with <entity id=5887>Jaime</entity> , as well as <entity id=5888>Loras</entity> 's well-known homosexuality . <entity id=5889>Tywin</entity> is adamant that <entity id=5890>Cersei</entity> , whom he calls the <entity id=5891>Kingdom</entity> 's most beautiful woman , should marry <entity id=5892>Loras</entity> , the <entity id=5891>Kingdom</entity> 's most handsome and desired bachelor , but <entity id=5893>Olenna</entity> blatantly refuses to consent , hinting that <entity id=5894>Joffrey</entity> is the result of incest . <entity id=5895>Tywin</entity> replies that if that is true , he has no right to the throne and the <entity id=5896>Tyrells</entity> just `` threw a flower into the dirt '' . <entity id=5897>Olenna</entity> says she will not risk `` throwing another flower into the dirt '' if <entity id=5898>Cersei</entity> can not bear heirs for the <entity id=5899>Tyrells</entity> . Realizing her unchanged position on the matter , <entity id=5900>Tywin</entity> threatens to make Loras a knight of the <entity id=5901>Kingsguard</entity> , which would force <entity id=5902>Loras</entity> to give up his right to marriage and to inherit <entity id=5903>Highgarden</entity> . <entity id=5904>Olenna</entity> relents , and consents to the marriage of <entity id=5905>Loras</entity> and <entity id=5906>Cersei</entity> . In the gardens , <entity id=5907>Sansa Stark</entity> tries to get closer to Loras by discussing their hopefully impending wedding . <entity id=5908>Loras</entity> is clearly uncomfortable being so close to her , but brightens when discussing the lavish wedding he 's had planned â€“ although <entity id=5909>Sansa</entity> , for once , becomes suspicious when she realizes that <entity id=5908>Loras</entity> seems more excited by the food and the wedding joust than by her . <entity id=5910>Loras</entity> quickly placates her with a compliment and then describes the wedding gown he 's envisioned for her . <entity id=5911>Sansa</entity> says she 's looking forward to seeing <entity id=5912>Highgarden</entity> , as she 's only ever lived in <entity id=5913>Winterfell</entity> and ca n't wait to leave King 's Landing . In this , <entity id=5914>Loras</entity> finds unexpected common ground with her and agrees that the <entity id=5915>Red Keep</entity> is `` the most terrible place there is '' . <entity id=5916>Cersei</entity> and <entity id=5917>Tyrion Lannister</entity> observe the couple from <entity id=5916>Cersei</entity> 's chambers overlooking the garden . <entity id=5918>Tyrion</entity> sarcastically asks which of the four of them has it the worst . He then finally accuses his sister of trying to have him killed during the <entity id=5919>Battle</entity> of the <entity id=5920>Blackwater</entity> . <entity id=5921>Cersei</entity> , tired of fighting him , remains quiet while he deduces that only two people can command the <entity id=5922>Kingsguard</entity> . <entity id=5923>Tyrion</entity> realizes that while <entity id=5924>Cersei</entity> certainly has the authority to command a <entity id=5925>Kingsguard</entity> , she is n't stupid enough to command <entity id=5926>Ser Mandon Moore</entity> to kill him in public . <entity id=5927>Tyrion</entity> realizes that it was in fact Joffrey who ordered <entity id=5928>Ser Mandon Moore</entity> to kill him , because <entity id=5927>Tyrion</entity> was the only one who stood up to him . <entity id=5929>Cersei</entity> tells him his life is not in danger from <entity id=5930>Joffrey</entity> , as he dare not try anything like that now that <entity id=5931>Tywin</entity> is the <entity id=5932>Hand</entity> . They discuss about <entity id=5933>Jaime</entity> 's possible return to <entity id=5934>King</entity> 's Landing , with <entity id=5935>Cersei</entity> wondering where he could possibly be . She asks <entity id=5936>Tyrion</entity> which one of them should be the one to break the news to <entity id=5937>Sansa</entity> . <entity id=5938>Tyrion</entity> decides he might as well dash <entity id=5939>Sansa</entity> 's hopes sooner rather than later . He goes to <entity id=5940>Sansa</entity> 's chamber and asks for a private word , but <entity id=5940>Sansa</entity> declines to dismiss <entity id=5941>Shae</entity> . <entity id=5942>Tyrion</entity> gives <entity id=5943>Shae</entity> a carefully coded apology for not telling her in private before breaking the news to <entity id=5944>Sansa</entity> . Later on , <entity id=5945>Lord Varys</entity> finds <entity id=5946>Lord Petyr Baelish</entity> in the throne room . <entity id=5947>Varys</entity> and <entity id=5948>Baelish</entity> discuss the <entity id=5949>Iron Throne</entity> and the pageantry and propaganda that creates nations and cements dynasties . <entity id=5950>Varys</entity> asserts that he serves the realm , but <entity id=5951>Baelish</entity> scoffs that `` the realm '' is an invention of Aegon the <entity id=5952>Conqueror</entity> . <entity id=5953>Baelish</entity> tells Varys that he is aware of <entity id=5954>Varys</entity> ' arrangement with <entity id=5955>Ros</entity> , and that he has given her to `` a friend '' who is eager for a new experience . <entity id=5956>Baelish</entity> revels in the chaos that he has caused , likening chaos to a ladder ( for those brave enough to climb ) rather than a pit to be lost in , as <entity id=5957>Varys</entity> and everyone else sees it . <entity id=5958>Joffrey</entity> kills <entity id=5959>Ros</entity> . Elsewhere , <entity id=5960>Sansa</entity> weeps as <entity id=5961>Baelish</entity> 's ship departs , both of her plans to leave King 's Landing in tatters . Meanwhile , <entity id=5962>Joffrey</entity> coldly contemplates <entity id=5963>Ros</entity> 's quarrel-ridden corpse . In the <entity id=5964>Riverlands</entity> , the hideout of the <entity id=5965>Brotherhood</entity> without <entity id=5966>Banners</entity> outside of <entity id=5967>Hollow Hill</entity> , <entity id=5968>Anguy</entity> trains <entity id=5969>Arya Stark</entity> with a bow . <entity id=5970>Anguy</entity> teaching <entity id=5971>Arya</entity> how to shoot a bow better . <entity id=5972>Arya</entity> spots someone behind her target , which is revealed to be <entity id=5973>Melisandre</entity> and a small group of <entity id=5974>Stannis Baratheon</entity> 's men . She speaks to Thoros in <entity id=5975>High Valyrian</entity> , demanding to know what became of his mission to convert <entity id=5976>Robert Baratheon</entity> to the worship of the <entity id=5977>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5978>Light</entity> . He bluntly tells her he failed . <entity id=5979>Melisandre</entity> is brought to the <entity id=5980>Brotherhood</entity> 's hideout and is shocked when she learns of the six deaths of <entity id=5981>Beric Dondarrion</entity> , exclaiming that <entity id=5982>Thoros</entity> should not have that kind of power . <entity id=5983>Thoros</entity> counters that he has no power , he only asks for favors and the <entity id=5984>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5985>Light</entity> sees fit to grant them . The priestess seems troubled by his response ( or perhaps by the fact that the <entity id=5986>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5987>Light</entity> looks favorably on causes other than her own ) . <entity id=5988>Melisandre</entity> says the <entity id=5989>Brotherhood</entity> has someone the <entity id=5990>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5991>Light</entity> needs , and soon after has her men take <entity id=5992>Gendry</entity> into her custody . <entity id=5993>Arya</entity> protests , particularly when she sees that <entity id=5994>Melisandre</entity> has given the <entity id=5995>Brotherhood</entity> two heavy sacks of gold in exchange . She confronts the red priestess , calling her a witch . <entity id=5996>Melisandre</entity> ignores the barb and looks into <entity id=5997>Arya</entity> 's eyes . She sees many other eyes , of many other colors- eyes that <entity id=5998>Arya</entity> will shut forever . <entity id=5999>Melisandre</entity> abruptly tells her that they will meet again . <entity id=6000>Edmure</entity> is enraged at having to marry <entity id=6001>Roslin</entity> . At <entity id=6002>Riverrun</entity> , King <entity id=6003>Robb Stark</entity> and his advisors meet with `` <entity id=6004>Black Walder</entity> '' and <entity id=6005>Lothar Frey</entity> to discuss an alliance for his planned attack on Casterly Rock . The <entity id=6006>Freys</entity> carry <entity id=6007>Walder Frey</entity> 's demands for an alliance , which includes a formal apology from <entity id=6008>Robb</entity> , the castle <entity id=6009>Harrenhal</entity> and all of its lands and incomes , and for <entity id=6010>Edmure Tully</entity> to marry <entity id=6011>Roslin</entity> , one of his daughters . <entity id=6012>Edmure</entity> is reluctant to marry a woman he has never met , but is eventually convinced by the group to go through with the arrangement . <entity id=6013>Jaime</entity> and <entity id=6014>Bolton</entity> discuss <entity id=6013>Jaime</entity> 's release . At <entity id=6015>Harrenhal</entity> , <entity id=6016>Lord Roose Bolton</entity> has dinner with <entity id=6017>Jaime</entity> and <entity id=6018>Brienne</entity> of <entity id=6019>Tarth</entity> . <entity id=6020>Bolton</entity> tells Jaime he will send him to <entity id=6021>King</entity> 's Landing as restitution for his lost hand but only on the condition that Jaime swear to tell his father that <entity id=6020>Bolton</entity> was not personally responsible for maiming him . <entity id=6022>Jaime</entity> assumes that <entity id=6023>Brienne</entity> will accompany him , but <entity id=6024>Bolton</entity> intends to keep her with him , under arrest for abetting treason . In the <entity id=6025>North</entity> , tensions rise at camp between <entity id=6026>Osha</entity> and <entity id=6027>Meera Reed</entity> before <entity id=6028>Bran Stark</entity> diffuses the situation . <entity id=6029>Jojen Jojen</entity> experiences a seizure while sleeping , and <entity id=6030>Meera</entity> explains they are caused by his visions . <entity id=6031>Jojen</entity> then tells <entity id=6032>Bran</entity> that in his vision he saw <entity id=6033>Jon Snow</entity> with the wildlings . <entity id=6034>Theon</entity> is tortured Elsewhere , the cleaning boy awakens <entity id=6035>Theon Greyjoy</entity> to continue torturing him . The boy threatens to remove <entity id=6036>Theon</entity> 's pinky finger if he can not guess the boy 's true identity and their current location . He gives the impression that <entity id=6037>Theon</entity> guessed right when <entity id=6037>Theon</entity> says he is the younger brother of <entity id=6038>Torrhen Karstark</entity> , <entity id=6039>Rickard Karstark's</entity> son , and that they are in <entity id=6040>Karhold</entity> . But then , the boy tells Theon he was lying , and begins flaying <entity id=6041>Theon</entity> 's finger while telling him that he is torturing Theon only for his own amusement . Beyond the <entity id=6042>Wall</entity> . <entity id=6043>Samwell Samwell</entity> and <entity id=6044>Gilly</entity> stop to camp during their journey to The Wall after having fled <entity id=6045>Craster</entity> 's Keep . <entity id=6046>Sam</entity> shows Gilly the <entity id=6047>Dragonglass</entity> dagger he found at the <entity id=6048>Fist</entity> of the <entity id=6049>First Men</entity> and tells her about <entity id=6050>Castle Black</entity> . <entity id=6051>Jon</entity> and <entity id=6052>Ygritte</entity> kissing on the top of the wall . At camp at the base of the <entity id=6053>Wall</entity> , the wildling party led by <entity id=6054>Tormund Giantsbane</entity> prepare to climb . <entity id=6055>Jon Jon</entity> and <entity id=6056>Ygritte</entity> talk about their impending climb and their relationship . <entity id=6057>Ygritte</entity> reveals she is aware that <entity id=6058>Jon</entity> is still loyal to the <entity id=6059>Night's Watch</entity> , but tells him he must be loyal to each other instead . While climbing , <entity id=6060>Ygritte</entity> strikes the <entity id=6061>Wall</entity> and causes a massive crack , which dislodges a large sheet of ice , sending several wildlings to their deaths . <entity id=6062>Ygritte</entity> and <entity id=6063>Jon</entity> hang precariously by their safety rope . <entity id=6064>Orell</entity> decides that <entity id=6065>Tormund</entity> can not continue climbing with the weight of <entity id=6066>Jon</entity> and <entity id=6067>Ygritte</entity> 's bodies pulling them down and begins cutting the rope . <entity id=6068>Jon</entity> sees what <entity id=6069>Orell</entity> is doing and barely manages to swing to his left and plant a hook in the ice , saving himself and <entity id=6070>Ygritte</entity> . They reach the top of the wall , and <entity id=6071>Ygritte</entity> is awed by the view beyond the wall and to the south , before she and <entity id=6072>Jon</entity> share a passionate kiss .
