<entity class="NE" id=4371>Tyrion</entity> gains new responsibilities ; <entity class="NE" id=4372>Jon</entity> is taken to the <entity class="NE" id=4373>Fist</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4374>First Men</entity> ; <entity class="NE" id=4375>Daenerys</entity> meets with the slavers ; Jaime strikes a deal with his captors . Across the <entity class="NE" id=4376>Narrow Sea</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=4377>Astapor</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4378>Daenerys</entity> , accompanied by <entity class="NE" id=4379>Ser Jorah Mormont</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4380>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> , walks along a sea wall known as the `` Walk of <entity class="NE" id=4381>Punishment</entity> . '' Here , any slave who showed insubordination of any type is strapped to a cross and left to die out in public , as a warning to all other slaves . <entity class="NE" id=4382>Daenerys</entity> offers a condemned man water , but he refuses to drink , saying he just wants to die quickly . <entity class="NE" id=4383>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4384>Barristan</entity> continue to disagree on whether or not <entity class="NE" id=4385>Daenerys</entity> should purchase the <entity class="NE" id=4386>Unsullied</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4387>Jorah</entity> insists that it is their only chance to get an army , but <entity class="NE" id=4388>Barristan</entity> believes this is not the honorable way , as slavery is illegal and abhorred in the <entity class="NE" id=4389>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4390>Jorah</entity> claims that not only will the slave soldiers be treated better in her service , but innocent people will also be spared in war because the <entity class="NE" id=4391>Unsullied</entity> only do as they are ordered . They have no human or masculine urges in their bodies , and therefore will not kill civilians or rape innocent women , unlike most male soldiers who would succumb to those urges in the heat of battle . <entity class="NE" id=4392>Barristan</entity> retorts that when her older brother <entity class="NE" id=4393>Rhaegar</entity> led his army in the <entity class="NE" id=4394>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4395>Trident</entity> , men fought and died for <entity class="NE" id=4393>Rhaegar</entity> because they believed in him , because they loved him - not because they were slave soldiers whose free will had been stripped away . <entity class="NE" id=4396>Jorah</entity> responds that <entity class="NE" id=4397>Rhaegar</entity> indeed fought honorably and nobly , but that in the end <entity class="NE" id=4397>Rhaegar</entity> died . <entity class="NE" id=4398>Daenerys</entity> was born months after <entity class="NE" id=4399>Robert Baratheon</entity> killed <entity class="NE" id=4400>Rhaegar</entity> at the <entity class="NE" id=4401>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4402>Trident</entity> , and only knew her cruel and half-mad brother <entity class="NE" id=4403>Viserys</entity> , so she asks <entity class="NE" id=4404>Ser Barristan</entity> if he knew <entity class="NE" id=4400>Rhaegar</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4405>Selmy</entity> was a member of the <entity class="NE" id=4406>Targaryen Kingsguard</entity> and thus knew <entity class="NE" id=4407>Rhaegar</entity> well : he fought beside him and bled beside him at the <entity class="NE" id=4408>Trident</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4409>Barristan</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=4410>Rhaegar</entity> was the finest man he ever met , the last dragon . <entity class="NE" id=4411>Daenerys</entity> grows quiet and says she wishes she 'd known her older brother , but that <entity class="NE" id=4412>Rhaegar</entity> was not the last dragon ( she is ) . <entity class="NE" id=4413>Daenerys</entity> speaks with <entity class="NE" id=4414>Kraznys</entity> mo <entity class="NE" id=4415>Nakloz</entity> , as he shows her his slave soldiers , the <entity class="NE" id=4416>Unsullied</entity> . He repeatedly insults and mocks Daenerys in his native tongue , leaving his slave translator Missandei of <entity class="NE" id=4417>Naath</entity> to clean up his crude and very insulting words into more respectful language . At one point , she pauses , wondering how to twist a particularly coarse insult from <entity class="NE" id=4418>Kraznys</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=4419>Daenerys</entity> notices her reluctance to directly translate . <entity class="NE" id=4420>Daenerys</entity> says she will take all 8,000 Unsullied soldiers , including those in training . <entity class="NE" id=4421>Kraznys</entity> laughs and retorts that she can barely afford 100 Unsullied . <entity class="NE" id=4422>Daenerys</entity> surprises him by telling him she has dragons , and is willing to trade one . This offer stops <entity class="NE" id=4423>Kraznys</entity> in his tracks , yet <entity class="NE" id=4424>Daenerys</entity> repeatedly affirms that he may only have one of her dragons . They strike a deal that she may have all the <entity class="NE" id=4425>Unsullied</entity> soldiers in exchange for her biggest dragon . Both <entity class="NE" id=4426>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4427>Selmy</entity> strongly object , and plead to Daenerys that while soldiers are valuable , it is dragons that will ultimately win her the <entity class="NE" id=4428>Iron Throne</entity> . She ignores them , and concludes the deal with <entity class="NE" id=4429>Kraznys</entity> , and also demands <entity class="NE" id=4430>Missandei</entity> as a token of faith . Upon leaving the room , she scolds <entity class="NE" id=4431>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4432>Selmy</entity> , telling them that while she values their advice , they should never again question her in public . <entity class="NE" id=4433>Daenerys</entity> speaks with <entity class="NE" id=4434>Missandei</entity> and asks her if she has a family ; she says no . <entity class="NE" id=4435>Daenerys</entity> tells her of the man who turned down her offer of water , and asks why he would simply say , `` Let me die . '' <entity class="NE" id=4436>Missandei</entity> replies that in the afterlife , there is no master . Thus , the man would rather be dead than alive in the <entity class="NE" id=4437>Slavers Bay</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4438>Daenerys</entity> proceeds to explain the dangers <entity class="NE" id=4439>Missandei</entity> will be facing in <entity class="NE" id=4438>Daenerys</entity> 's service and asks if that will be a problem . <entity class="NE" id=4440>Missandei</entity> simply replies , `` Valar morghulis '' ( `` all men must die '' ) . <entity class="NE" id=4441>Daenerys</entity> acknowledges the truth of the words , but quips , `` We are not men . `` . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=4442>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4443>Horses</entity> ' remains specially arranged by the <entity class="NE" id=4444>White Walkers</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=4445>Free Folk</entity> army of King-Beyond-the-Wall , <entity class="NE" id=4446>Mance Rayder</entity> , including <entity class="NE" id=4447>Jon Snow</entity> , arrive at the <entity class="NE" id=4448>Fist</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4449>First Men</entity> . They survey the bloody aftermath of assault on the <entity class="NE" id=4450>Night</entity> 's Watch by the <entity class="NE" id=4451>White Walkers</entity> and their army of undead wights . <entity class="NE" id=4452>Mance</entity> grimly remarks that the <entity class="NE" id=4453>White</entity> Walkers are `` always the artists '' : the severed corpses of all of the <entity class="NE" id=4454>Watch</entity> 's horses have been carefully arranged into a large-scale , ceremonial spiral pattern . However , there is no sign of any human corpses - which <entity class="NE" id=4455>Orell</entity> insists were there when he scouted ahead earlier by warging into his eagle , but have now vanished . <entity class="NE" id=4456>Jon</entity> says that there were three hundred men of the <entity class="NE" id=4457>Night's Watch</entity> at the <entity class="NE" id=4458>Fist</entity> , and asks Mance if <entity class="NE" id=4459>Mormont</entity> could still be alive . <entity class="NE" id=4460>Mance</entity> says that with <entity class="NE" id=4461>Mormont</entity> , it 's possible he was able to escape , but that even if he did he and his men took quite a beating and are trapped miles away from the <entity class="NE" id=4462>Wall</entity> with the <entity class="NE" id=4463>White Walkers</entity> in close pursuit . <entity class="NE" id=4464>Mance</entity> warns <entity class="NE" id=4465>Jon</entity> that all of the missing corpses from the Fist are no longer his friends and brothers from the <entity class="NE" id=4466>Night's Watch</entity> , but have been resurrected as undead monsters who serve the <entity class="NE" id=4467>White Walkers</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4468>Mance</entity> orders Tormund to take a force of twenty men to scale The <entity class="NE" id=4469>Wall</entity> to attack <entity class="NE" id=4470>Castle Black</entity> from its exposed rear . The fortresses of the <entity class="NE" id=4471>Night's Watch</entity> were purposefully built to only defend from attack over the <entity class="NE" id=4472>Wall</entity> , without defenses on their southern sides , so they would n't be a threat to the lords of the <entity class="NE" id=4473>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4474>Mance</entity> 's plan is for <entity class="NE" id=4475>Tormund</entity> 's small band to distract <entity class="NE" id=4476>Castle Black</entity> by attacking their exposed southern side , at which point <entity class="NE" id=4474>Mance</entity> 's main army will assault it from the north . <entity class="NE" id=4477>Tormund</entity> will know that Mance is in position when his army makes a massive signal fire ; <entity class="NE" id=4478>Mance</entity> boasts that `` I 'm going to make the biggest fire the <entity class="NE" id=4479>North</entity> has ever seen ! '' <entity class="NE" id=4480>Mance</entity> orders Tormund to take <entity class="NE" id=4481>Jon</entity> with him , as <entity class="NE" id=4481>Jon</entity> knows the layout of <entity class="NE" id=4482>Castle Black</entity> , and it will prove a key test of his loyalty : if it turns out that he wo n't really betray the <entity class="NE" id=4483>Night's Watch</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4484>Tormund</entity> can easily throw him off the <entity class="NE" id=4485>Wall</entity> to his death . <entity class="NE" id=4486>Farther</entity> south , <entity class="NE" id=4487>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entity> leads the ragged survivors of the <entity class="NE" id=4488>Night's Watch</entity> expedition to <entity class="NE" id=4489>Craster</entity> 's Keep . <entity class="NE" id=4490>Craster</entity> mocks the survivors of the <entity class="NE" id=4491>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4492>Fist</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4493>First Men</entity> when they reach his Keep . He initially wants to refuse them shelter until he notices some of them stroking their weapons . Fearful that in desperation they might try to rush him , he relents . As the black brothers warm by his hearth , <entity class="NE" id=4494>Craster</entity> mocks them . <entity class="NE" id=4495>Craster</entity> insists that the black brothers should be grateful for his generosity , and that he is a `` godly man '' for helping them . <entity class="NE" id=4496>Mormont</entity> tensely questions <entity class="NE" id=4497>Craster</entity> 's claim to be a godly man , but <entity class="NE" id=4497>Craster</entity> insists that he is - to the `` real gods , '' the <entity class="NE" id=4498>White Walkers</entity> , who consume entire armies on their way to the Wall but will spare <entity class="NE" id=4497>Craster</entity> for his loyalty . He admits that he 's feeding his pigs better than them - as pigs are valuable to him - and half-seriously suggests to his guests that they should eat the fat <entity class="NE" id=4499>Samwell Tarly</entity> . He is also annoyed by <entity class="NE" id=4500>Gilly</entity> 's loud wailing from birthing pains . <entity class="NE" id=4501>Sam</entity> leaves the main house to a birthing hut where he witnesses Gilly giving birth with the aid of a few other women . To her horror , the baby is a boy . <entity class="NE" id=4502>Sam</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4503>Gilly</entity> wordlessly realize that <entity class="NE" id=4504>Craster</entity> will want to sacrifice him to the <entity class="NE" id=4505>White Walkers</entity> . In the <entity class="NE" id=4506>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4507>Brynden</entity> takes aim . At <entity class="NE" id=4508>Riverrun</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=4509>Riverlands</entity> , the castle-seat of <entity class="HSE" id=4510>House Tully</entity> , the funeral of the recently deceased <entity class="NE" id=4511>Lord Hoster Tully</entity> is held on the banks of the <entity class="NE" id=4512>Red Fork</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4513>Trident River</entity> . King <entity class="NE" id=4514>Robb Stark</entity> has arrived with the main force of the <entity class="NE" id=4515>Northern</entity> army , and he helps launch his maternal grandfather 's funeral boat , along with <entity class="NE" id=4516>Hoster</entity> 's younger brother <entity class="NE" id=4517>Brynden</entity> `` The <entity class="NE" id=4518>Blackfish</entity> '' Tully . <entity class="NE" id=4519>Catelyn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4520>Robb</entity> 's new wife <entity class="NE" id=4521>Queen Talisa</entity> look on with the assembled crowd of bannermen on the dock . <entity class="NE" id=4522>Hoster</entity> 's youngest child , <entity class="NE" id=4523>Catelyn</entity> 's younger brother <entity class="NE" id=4524>Edmure Tully</entity> , attempts to light the funeral boat on fire with a flaming arrow but fails three times . Just as the boat is about to disappear around a bend of the river , <entity class="NE" id=4525>Brynden</entity> pushes his nephew out of the way and skillfully makes the shot . Knowing his accuracy was true and the shot would hit the boat , the <entity class="NE" id=4526>Blackfish</entity> turns around to walk away ( dismissively showing up <entity class="NE" id=4527>Edmure</entity> at the same time ) as soon as he releases the arrow . In <entity class="NE" id=4528>Catelyn</entity> 's old chamber in the castle , she mourns with her uncle <entity class="NE" id=4529>Brynden</entity> over her father 's death . She asks him if he made peace with his older brother , with whom he had been fighting for the past thirty years . <entity class="NE" id=4530>Brynden</entity> explains that he did : on his deathbed <entity class="NE" id=4531>Hoster</entity> told him to stop calling himself `` the <entity class="NE" id=4532>Blackfish</entity> '' as it was a stupid joke created over thirty years ago by <entity class="NE" id=4530>Brynden</entity> to symbolize his bad relationship with his older brother , and it was n't very funny to begin with . <entity class="NE" id=4533>Brynden</entity> emotionally joked back to his dying brother that people had been calling him `` Blackfish '' for so long that they 'd practically forgotten his real name . <entity class="NE" id=4534>Catelyn</entity> is happy that her uncle was able to make peace with her father before he passed , and is upset that she could n't have been there . She reminisces that she watched from this window in her childhood whenever her father left , but now he wo n't be coming back . She tearfully wonders if her sons <entity class="NE" id=4535>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4536>Rickon</entity> similarly watched at <entity class="NE" id=4537>Winterfell</entity> for her return when she failed to arrive to save them . <entity class="NE" id=4538>Brynden</entity> insists that neither he nor <entity class="NE" id=4539>Robb</entity> have given up hope that the boys may be alive and in hiding , and urges her to be strong for <entity class="NE" id=4539>Robb</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4540>Tyrion</entity> is fascinated at <entity class="NE" id=4541>Pod</entity> 's ability to pleasure women . King <entity class="NE" id=4542>Robb</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4543>Brynden</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=4544>Edmure</entity> confer in <entity class="NE" id=4545>Riverrun</entity> 's meeting room . The war is not going well for them . The Lannisters have defeated their enemies in the south and secured <entity class="NE" id=4546>King</entity> 's Landing from attack , as well as a marriage-alliance with <entity class="HSE" id=4547>House Tyrell</entity> . They have superior numbers , wealth , and strategic position . <entity class="NE" id=4548>Edmure</entity> begins to speak of his recent victory at the <entity class="NE" id=4549>Battle</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4550>Stone Mill</entity> , which pushed the <entity class="NE" id=4551>Lannister</entity> army under <entity class="NE" id=4552>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> from the <entity class="NE" id=4553>Riverlands</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4554>Robb</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4555>Brynden</entity> , however , are furious with <entity class="NE" id=4556>Edmure</entity> : their grand strategy was to lure <entity class="NE" id=4557>Tywin</entity> and Gregor's armies into the <entity class="NE" id=4558>Westerlands</entity> , where they would be vulnerable , out of position , and unable to defend the capital against the <entity class="NE" id=4559>Baratheons</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4560>Edmure</entity> 's role in this was to offer token defense as a feint to lure the <entity class="NE" id=4561>Lannisters</entity> back west across the <entity class="NE" id=4562>Red Fork</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4563>Trident</entity> . Instead , by successfully attacking the Lannisters at <entity class="NE" id=4564>Stone Mill</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4565>Edmure</entity> kept them penned in the <entity class="NE" id=4566>Riverlands</entity> , and thus close enough to <entity class="NE" id=4567>King</entity> 's Landing that <entity class="NE" id=4568>Tywin</entity> was able to rush to the defense of the city at the <entity class="NE" id=4569>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4570>Blackwater</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=4571>Starks</entity> ' strategic position in the war has been ruined . <entity class="NE" id=4572>Edmure</entity> insists that they took valuable captives in the battle , <entity class="NE" id=4573>Willem</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4574>Martyn Lannister</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=4575>Robb</entity> angrily points out that he did n't stop fighting because his sisters are held captive . Considering that <entity class="NE" id=4576>Tywin</entity> did n't stop to negotiate when his own eldest son was captured , taking his younger nephews hostage will have no impact on the war . <entity class="NE" id=4577>Edmure</entity> tries to at least point out that they lost only two hundred men at <entity class="NE" id=4578>Stone Mill</entity> and multiple Lannister soldiers died for every man they lost , at which <entity class="NE" id=4579>Robb</entity> cuts him off and shouts that they need their men more than <entity class="NE" id=4580>Tywin Lannister</entity> needs his ( who already outnumber the <entity class="NE" id=4581>Starks</entity> significantly ) . At this point , the Lannisters are in such a good strategic position that they can afford to be patient , and grind down <entity class="NE" id=4582>Robb</entity> 's forces through simple attrition . In the prison cells at <entity class="NE" id=4583>Riverrun</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4584>Queen Talisa</entity> bandages the minor wounds of <entity class="NE" id=4585>Willem</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4586>Martyn Lannister</entity> . They are boys , only 14 and 15 years old . One of them asks if <entity class="NE" id=4587>Robb</entity> really transforms into a wolf eats the flesh of his enemies . <entity class="NE" id=4588>Talisa</entity> says yes - but that he does not eat the flesh of children , except during the full moon . She asks a guard if it 's currently a full moon , and reassures the now terrified child that he is safe . <entity class="NE" id=4589>Wolf Wolf</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=4590>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=4591>Tywin Lannister</entity> calls the first meeting of the <entity class="NE" id=4592>Small Council</entity> since he arrived in the city and assumed his position as <entity class="NE" id=4593>Hand</entity> of the King . He has the meeting place changed to a room next to his own quarters in the Tower of the <entity class="NE" id=4594>Hand</entity> , asserting his dominance . <entity class="NE" id=4595>Tywin</entity> arrives early and has all of the council members called in at once . All of the seats are on one side of the table , as a non-verbal test to see how each of them reacts around him . <entity class="NE" id=4596>Petyr Petyr</entity> ambitiously pushes his way past everyone else to be the one who sits closest to <entity class="NE" id=4597>Tywin</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4598>Varys</entity> rolls his eyes at <entity class="NE" id=4599>Littlefinger</entity> 's naked ambition and lets him pass , content to sit in the second-closest seat ( for now ) . <entity class="NE" id=4600>Grand Grand</entity> , who is most focused on survival by avoiding direct conflict , does n't try to fight over a better seat with either of them , instead quietly taking the third seat away from <entity class="NE" id=4601>Tywin</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4602>Tywin</entity> 's daughter <entity class="NE" id=4603>Cersei</entity> arrives to find the seats are all occupied , but not wanting to play that game and be relegated to a lowly position , she pulls up a chair so she is sitting at <entity class="NE" id=4602>Tywin</entity> 's right hand , opposite Littlefinger . <entity class="NE" id=4604>Tyrion</entity> is the only one who even mildly stands up to <entity class="NE" id=4605>Tywin</entity> 's posturing , by not even trying to sit closest to Tywin : instead he takes a new chair and makes a point of noisily dragging it across the ground until it is positioned at the exact opposite end of the table from his father . <entity class="NE" id=4606>Tywin</entity> is upset with the three advisors , noting that between them , they possess the greatest number of spies in the world , yet none of them can locate his son <entity class="NE" id=4607>Jaime</entity> , even though the entire <entity class="NE" id=4608>Northern</entity> army has heard of his escape . <entity class="NE" id=4609>Tywin</entity> asks what news there is of the war , and <entity class="NE" id=4610>Varys</entity> reports that <entity class="NE" id=4611>Robb</entity> has taken the bulk of his army to Riverrun for his grandfather 's funeral , while leaving <entity class="NE" id=4612>Lord Roose Bolton</entity> in command of <entity class="NE" id=4613>Harrenhal</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4614>Varys</entity> makes a jab at <entity class="NE" id=4615>Littlefinger</entity> 's recent , titular promotion as <entity class="NE" id=4616>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4617>Harrenhal</entity> , noting that this makes <entity class="NE" id=4618>Roose Bolton</entity> the current Lord of <entity class="NE" id=4617>Harrenhal</entity> in practice if not in name . However , <entity class="NE" id=4619>Tywin</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=4620>Roose</entity> can keep it , because the title alone is enough to give Littlefinger the social standing to be a suitor to <entity class="NE" id=4621>Lady Lysa Arryn</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4622>Littlefinger</entity> states that they have known each other since childhood , and <entity class="NE" id=4623>Lysa</entity> has always adored him , and thus she will soon remarry to him . <entity class="NE" id=4624>Pycelle</entity> notes that this will make Littlefinger the acting <entity class="NE" id=4625>Lord Paramount</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4626>Vale</entity> , an even more important position ( <entity class="NE" id=4627>Baelish</entity> is even wearing a more expensive tunic than usual , laced with gold , to reflect his new status ) . <entity class="NE" id=4628>Theon</entity> is nearly raped by his torturer . <entity class="NE" id=4629>Tywin</entity> states that this will confirm that the <entity class="NE" id=4630>Vale</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4631>Arryn</entity> , which has been neutral in the war up to now , will not support <entity class="NE" id=4632>Robb Stark</entity> , who is increasingly being hemmed in by enemies ( other marriage alliances , with <entity class="HSE" id=4633>House Tyrell</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4634>Reach</entity> and <entity class="HSE" id=4635>House Martell</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4636>Dorne</entity> , combined with the crushing of the <entity class="NE" id=4637>Baratheons</entity> , have in turn secured the rest of southern <entity class="NE" id=4638>Westeros</entity> under <entity class="NE" id=4639>Lannister</entity> control ) . <entity class="NE" id=4640>Tyrion</entity> points out that if <entity class="NE" id=4641>Baelish</entity> departs for the Vale that leaves a vacancy on the <entity class="NE" id=4642>Small Council</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=4643>Tywin</entity> reveals that he has appointed <entity class="NE" id=4640>Tyrion</entity> as the new Master of <entity class="NE" id=4644>Coin</entity> to replace him . While this may seem like giving Tyrion a position of relative power again , <entity class="NE" id=4645>Tyrion</entity> quickly points out that he has no prior experience in finance . With backhanded compliments , <entity class="NE" id=4646>Cersei</entity> makes it clear that this promotion is really intended to give him an opportunity to make mistakes he will be blamed for . After the meeting , <entity class="NE" id=4647>Tyrion</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4648>Podrick Payne</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=4649>Ser Bronn</entity> drop by <entity class="NE" id=4650>Littlefinger</entity> 's office in his brothel , where he keeps his ledgers . <entity class="NE" id=4651>Pod</entity> loads them all into a cart as <entity class="NE" id=4652>Ros</entity> flirts with him . <entity class="NE" id=4653>Littlefinger</entity> says it was the safest place to keep such records , but <entity class="NE" id=4654>Tyrion</entity> notes that his brothel has n't been the safest place for bastards . <entity class="NE" id=4655>Baelish</entity> says he hopes <entity class="NE" id=4656>Tyrion</entity> does well in the position , as he owes him for securing the release of <entity class="NE" id=4657>Ros</entity> ( after <entity class="NE" id=4658>Cersei</entity> arrested her , mistaking her for <entity class="NE" id=4659>Shae</entity> ) but <entity class="NE" id=4656>Tyrion</entity> says it was just a misunderstanding . <entity class="NE" id=4660>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4661>Bronn</entity> then lead <entity class="NE" id=4662>Pod</entity> into another room of the brothel , where <entity class="NE" id=4660>Tyrion</entity> says that he wants to reward him for saving his life during the <entity class="NE" id=4663>Battle</entity> of the Blackwater : he has paid for <entity class="NE" id=4664>Podrick</entity> ( who has never had sex with a woman ) to enjoy the services of not one , but three prostitutes : <entity class="NE" id=4665>Marei</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4666>Genna</entity> , and a contortionist named <entity class="NE" id=4667>Kayla</entity> ( one of only four women in the world who can properly perform a `` Meereenese Knot '' ) . Later , <entity class="NE" id=4668>Tyrion</entity> is reading through the financial records , and explains to Bronn that not all is as <entity class="NE" id=4669>Baelish</entity> would like the court to think . <entity class="NE" id=4670>Bronn</entity> asks if he thinks <entity class="NE" id=4671>Littlefinger</entity> has been stealing to obtain the crown 's money , but <entity class="NE" id=4672>Tyrion</entity> says the problem is more that he 's been borrowing all of it . Littlefinger always acted like he was a financial genius who could raise money seemingly out of nowhere , but in reality the <entity class="NE" id=4673>Iron Throne</entity> is heavily in debt , and <entity class="NE" id=4674>Littlefinger</entity> procured enough money to balance the books every year by borrowing massive sums of money from foreign banks . <entity class="NE" id=4675>Brienne</entity> is beaten down as the captors prepare to rape her . In particular , much of their debt is owed to the <entity class="NE" id=4676>Iron Bank</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4677>Braavos</entity> , the largest bank in the <entity class="NE" id=4678>Free Cities</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4679>Tyrion</entity> warns <entity class="NE" id=4680>Bronn</entity> that when debtors to the <entity class="NE" id=4681>Iron Bank</entity> can not repay their loans , the <entity class="NE" id=4681>Iron Bank</entity> will first refuse to give out new loans , and ultimately support rebellions against them . <entity class="NE" id=4682>Tyrion</entity> fears that if they ca n't repay the debt , the <entity class="NE" id=4683>Iron Bank</entity> will eventually cut them off and start supporting <entity class="NE" id=4684>Robb Stark</entity> or <entity class="NE" id=4685>Stannis Baratheon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4686>Podrick</entity> then returns , with the money <entity class="NE" id=4687>Tyrion</entity> gave him to pay the prostitutes . <entity class="NE" id=4688>Tyrion</entity> is concerned that he lost heart and fled , but <entity class="NE" id=4689>Pod</entity> innocently says he did `` all sorts of things '' with the prostitutes - they simply refused his offer of payment . Impressed that the women would provide their services for free , <entity class="NE" id=4690>Tyrion</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4691>Bronn</entity> ask <entity class="NE" id=4692>Pod</entity> to explain in detail what transpired , so they can take `` copious notes . `` . At <entity class="NE" id=4693>Dragonstone</entity> , King <entity class="NE" id=4694>Stannis Baratheon</entity> speaks with <entity class="NE" id=4695>Melisandre</entity> as she prepares to depart by boat . He is worried that his enemies think he is defeated and are laughing at him , and that now even she is abandoning him . She assures him that she still thinks he is the <entity class="NE" id=4696>Lord</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=4697>Chosen</entity> , but she must travel to the <entity class="NE" id=4698>Riverlands</entity> to obtain something vital for his cause . <entity class="NE" id=4699>Stannis</entity> says that he wants her , and that he wants <entity class="NE" id=4700>Joffrey</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4701>Robb</entity> dead , and asks her to make `` a son '' again with him ( like the Shadow-creature she conjured to assassinate <entity class="NE" id=4702>Renly</entity> ) . <entity class="NE" id=4703>Melisandre</entity> says that she can not : creating a shadow-creature drains some of the fire of a man 's life-force , and she fears that creating another would kill <entity class="NE" id=4704>Stannis</entity> . Over his protests , she explains that what she is seeking is even more powerful than a shadow-creature , and will change his fortunes in this war , but she needs a king 's blood to do it . <entity class="NE" id=4705>Stannis</entity> does n't understand , but <entity class="NE" id=4706>Melisandre</entity> implies that she needs to burn a human sacrifice who possesses a king 's blood as an offering to the <entity class="NE" id=4707>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4708>Light</entity> . She ca n't kill <entity class="NE" id=4709>Stannis</entity> himself to achieve this , but as she points out , `` There are others with your blood in their veins '' - any of his brother King <entity class="NE" id=4710>Robert</entity> 's bastard children who managed to survive the purge . At the <entity class="NE" id=4711>Inn</entity> at the <entity class="NE" id=4712>Crossroads</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=4713>Riverlands</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4714>Arya Stark</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4715>Gendry</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=4716>Hot Pie</entity> are still in the company of the <entity class="NE" id=4717>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> , who are preparing to depart . <entity class="NE" id=4718>Gendry</entity> has finished fixing a steel breastplate which <entity class="NE" id=4719>Thoros</entity> puts on , and <entity class="NE" id=4720>Arya</entity> asks why <entity class="NE" id=4718>Gendry</entity> is helping them . <entity class="NE" id=4721>Thoros</entity> says that they 're not prisoners , it 's just that the war-torn Riverlands are n't a safe place for <entity class="NE" id=4722>Ned Stark</entity> 's daughter . <entity class="NE" id=4723>Arya</entity> notices that they are loading <entity class="NE" id=4724>Sandor</entity> `` The <entity class="NE" id=4725>Hound</entity> '' <entity class="NE" id=4726>Clegane</entity> into a prisoner cart , so she walks over and angrily asks him if he remembers the last time he was here , but he simply says all poor inns look the same . <entity class="NE" id=4727>Jaime</entity> loses his sword-hand . As they get ready to leave , <entity class="NE" id=4728>Hot Pie</entity> explains that he is n't going with them : he baked some bread for the innkeeper , and as he was a baker 's apprentice when he lived in <entity class="NE" id=4729>King</entity> 's Landing , the innkeeper thought it was the best bread they 'd ever had , and offered him a job . This life of fighting and travelling is n't really for him , plus <entity class="NE" id=4730>Thoros</entity> formally made a deal with the innkeeper to pay for the free meals they enjoyed with <entity class="NE" id=4731>Hot Pie</entity> 's services . Before they go , he gives Arya a present he made for her : a loaf of bread shaped like a direwolf , though <entity class="NE" id=4732>Arya</entity> implies the tail looks like a head . <entity class="NE" id=4733>Arya</entity> is a bit brusque but the three wish each other well as they depart , and as they are riding away <entity class="NE" id=4733>Arya</entity> starts eating the wolf-bread , and turns back to shout to <entity class="NE" id=4734>Hot Pie</entity> that it is very good . At an undisclosed location , <entity class="NE" id=4735>Theon Greyjoy</entity> escapes from the dungeon with the help of a young man , who gives him a horse and tells him to ride east . Theon thanks him and says he 'll make him a lord of the <entity class="NE" id=4736>Iron Islands</entity> for this , but the boy says that they are n't in the <entity class="NE" id=4736>Iron Islands</entity> now . <entity class="NE" id=4737>Theon</entity> is later hunted down by his captors in a prolonged chase on horseback through the woods . Ultimately his pursuers split into two groups and trap Theon between them , and he is knocked off his horse with a flail . <entity class="NE" id=4738>Theon</entity> 's captors pin him to the ground , and pull down his pants : the leader declares that he intends to rape Theon as punishment for trying to run away . However , <entity class="NE" id=4739>Theon</entity> 's unidentified savior returns and snipes all of the captors from afar using his bow , rescuing him at the last minute . Somewhere else in the <entity class="NE" id=4740>Riverlands</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4741>Jaime Lannister</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4742>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4743>Tarth</entity> have been taken captive by <entity class="NE" id=4744>Locke</entity> and a detachment of men from <entity class="HSE" id=4745>House Bolton</entity> . As they ride along , the men sing a rousing chorus of The <entity class="NE" id=4746>Bear</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=4747>Maiden Fair</entity> . Tied up back to back on one of the horses , <entity class="NE" id=4748>Jaime</entity> warns <entity class="NE" id=4749>Brienne</entity> that when they make camp for the night , they will rape her , more than once , and that his honest advice is to give no resistance , and just think of <entity class="NE" id=4750>Renly</entity> . They were only sent to capture <entity class="NE" id=4751>Jaime</entity> , therefore <entity class="NE" id=4752>Brienne</entity> means nothing to them , so at the slightest provocation they will kill her without hesitation . <entity class="NE" id=4753>Brienne</entity> says she will fight even if they kill her , and <entity class="NE" id=4754>Jaime</entity> agrees that if he were a woman , he would fight to the death before being raped , too . Later that night <entity class="NE" id=4755>Locke</entity> 's men make camp , and do indeed drag <entity class="NE" id=4756>Brienne</entity> kicking and screaming into the bushes to gang-rape her . <entity class="NE" id=4757>Jaime</entity> is disgusted by this pointless brutality , so he points out to Locke that <entity class="NE" id=4758>Brienne</entity> is actually a noblewoman and the sole heir of <entity class="NE" id=4759>Lord Selwyn</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4760>Tarth</entity> , the `` <entity class="NE" id=4761>Sapphire Isle</entity> , '' and her father will pay them a ransom of her weight in sapphires - provided that she is unharmed . <entity class="NE" id=4762>Locke</entity> agrees and calls his men back before they are able to rape <entity class="NE" id=4763>Brienne</entity> , and they tie her up to a tree again . <entity class="NE" id=4764>Jaime</entity> tries to smooth-talk <entity class="NE" id=4765>Locke</entity> once again with offers of how his father <entity class="NE" id=4766>Tywin</entity> will make him extravagantly rich if he lets Jaime go . Tiring of <entity class="NE" id=4767>Jaime</entity> 's frequent attempts to bribe him into turning over to the Lannister side , <entity class="NE" id=4768>Locke</entity> decides to prove that Jaime 's father will never deal with the likes of him . At first <entity class="NE" id=4769>Locke</entity> has his men untie Jaime on the pretext of letting him go , but then his men hold him down on a chopping block while <entity class="NE" id=4769>Locke</entity> grabs a carving knife , threatening to stab Jaime in the eye . <entity class="NE" id=4770>Locke</entity> reasons that maiming <entity class="NE" id=4771>Tywin</entity> 's son will be the ultimate proof that the <entity class="NE" id=4772>Lannisters</entity> would never deal with <entity class="NE" id=4770>Locke</entity> , much less bribe him . <entity class="NE" id=4773>Locke</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=4774>Jaime</entity> 's father ca n't help him now , and `` this should help you remember ! '' - as he swings down the carving knife and hacks off <entity class="NE" id=4775>Jaime</entity> 's sword-hand . For half a second , <entity class="NE" id=4776>Jaime</entity> stares at his severed right hand in shock , before what just happened can register in his mind and then he begins to scream in horror .
