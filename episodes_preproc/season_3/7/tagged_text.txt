<entity class="NE" id=6043>Dany</entity> exchanges gifts with a slave lord outside of <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> . As <entity class="NE" id=6045>Sansa</entity> frets about her prospects , <entity class="NE" id=6046>Shae</entity> chafes at <entity class="NE" id=6047>Tyrion</entity> 's new situation . <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> counsels the king , and <entity class="NE" id=6049>Melisandre</entity> reveals a secret to <entity class="NE" id=6050>Gendry</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> faces a formidable foe in <entity class="NE" id=6052>Harrenhal</entity> . At the <entity class="NE" id=6053>Wall</entity> . After surviving the perilous climb of the <entity class="NE" id=6053>Wall</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6055>Jon Snow</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6056>Ygritte</entity> , and the wildlings led by <entity class="NE" id=6057>Tormund Giantsbane</entity> make their way towards <entity class="NE" id=6058>Castle Black</entity> to await <entity class="NE" id=6059>Mance Rayder's</entity> signal to begin the attack on the <entity class="NE" id=6060>Night's Watch</entity> . Afterwards Jon confronts Orell about cutting his and Ygritte's rope loose on The <entity class="NE" id=6053>Wall</entity> , nearly killing the both of them in the process . <entity class="NE" id=6062>Orell</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=6063>Jon</entity> that he does n't see <entity class="NE" id=6056>Ygritte</entity> complaining about what happened because she is a wildling and understood what needed to be done in a pressure situation , also telling <entity class="NE" id=6063>Jon</entity> that this is the reason he will never be able to keep her . During the journey through the woods , a clearly jealous <entity class="NE" id=6062>Orell</entity> confronts <entity class="NE" id=6056>Ygritte</entity> and says that he would be a better man for her than <entity class="NE" id=6055>Jon Snow</entity> , while continuing to express his distrust in <entity class="NE" id=6063>Jon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6063>Jon</entity> also tries to persuade <entity class="NE" id=6056>Ygritte</entity> that the wildlings ' cause is doomed to failure , but she refuses to listen and points out that <entity class="NE" id=6063>Jon</entity> is technically one of them ; if it fails , so does he . She renews her passion for him and tells him bluntly that if they die , they die , but before they die they will live in each other . Across the <entity class="NE" id=6071>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6072>Daenerys Daenerys</entity> 's army marches on to the next great city of <entity class="NE" id=6073>Slaver</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=6074>Bay</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> . She and <entity class="NE" id=6076>Barristan Selmy</entity> are confident they can take the city , given that <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> are famous for training bed slaves rather than soldiers . Ser Ser notes with wisdom however that <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> 's defenders wo n't fight them in open battle , being more likely to hole up behind their walls and chip away at the <entity class="NE" id=6079>Targaryen</entity> army with guerrilla tactics . He also advises <entity class="NE" id=6080>Daenerys</entity> that conquering <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> does not help them with their main goal of pressing on to retake <entity class="NE" id=6082>Westeros</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6043>Dany</entity> however is adamant on freeing the slaves of <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> , who number in the hundreds of thousands . She orders <entity class="NE" id=6085>Grey Worm</entity> to send a messenger to the city and inform <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> 's slaver rulers that they must either surrender or suffer the same fate as <entity class="NE" id=6087>Astapor</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=6088>Yunkish</entity> herald is carried into <entity class="NE" id=6080>Daenerys</entity> 's camp on a litter carried by slaves , along a road flanked by <entity class="NE" id=6090>Unsullied</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6091>Missandei</entity> announces the newcomer as <entity class="NE" id=6092>Razdal</entity> mo <entity class="NE" id=6093>Eraz</entity> , one of the ruling `` <entity class="NE" id=6094>Wise Masters</entity> '' of <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6080>Daenerys</entity> meets the man in her pavilion , flanked by her dragons who vie for her attention and fight over the pieces of meat she tosses to them ; they also snarl at <entity class="NE" id=6092>Razdal</entity> when he gets too close . <entity class="NE" id=6092>Razdal</entity> declares that <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> was an ancient civilization long before the rise of <entity class="NE" id=6100>Valyria</entity> and that numerous armies throughout history have tried and failed to conquer it . However <entity class="NE" id=6080>Daenerys</entity> is not threatened , commenting that a hard-fought battle would give her Unsullied much needed practice . <entity class="NE" id=6092>Razdal</entity> tries a different tact , asserting there is no need for their factions to fight , that <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> is willing to overlook her attack on <entity class="NE" id=6087>Astapor</entity> and will even provide her with the gold and ships needed to transport her army to <entity class="NE" id=6082>Westeros</entity> . In exchange , they ask that <entity class="NE" id=6080>Daenerys</entity> leave <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> in peace . <entity class="NE" id=6080>Daenerys</entity> makes a counter-offer : she will spare the lives of <entity class="NE" id=6092>Razdal</entity> and the slave-masters of <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> if every slave ( men , women and children ) in the city is set free , and given as much food , clothing and property as they can carry in payment for their services . She warns that if her offer is rejected , <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> will be shown no mercy . <entity class="NE" id=6092>Razdal</entity> takes offense , promising that <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> will be more of a challenge for her than <entity class="NE" id=6087>Astapor</entity> or <entity class="NE" id=6115>Qarth</entity> , and threatens her with the retribution of <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> 's `` powerful friends '' who he claims will take great pleasure in destroying her army and enslaving the survivors . At that , <entity class="NE" id=6116>Drogon</entity> and his siblings roar in anger ; <entity class="NE" id=6092>Razdal</entity> protests that he was promised safe conduct , to which <entity class="NE" id=6080>Daenerys</entity> counters that her dragons made no such promise and take offense to him threatening their mother . After the dragons prevent his slaves from reclaiming the chests of gold he brought with him , <entity class="NE" id=6092>Razdal</entity> storms out of the pavilion , muttering curses . <entity class="NE" id=6080>Daenerys</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=6121>Jorah</entity> to find out more about <entity class="NE" id=6044>Yunkai</entity> 's `` powerful friends '' before she commits herself to an attack on the city . In the <entity class="NE" id=6123>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . Traveling back from the <entity class="NE" id=6124>Riverlands</entity> , a ship carrying <entity class="NE" id=6049>Melisandre</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6050>Gendry</entity> leaves <entity class="NE" id=6127>King</entity> 's Landing and passes through <entity class="NE" id=6128>Blackwater Bay</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6049>Melisandre</entity> stares at the broken wrecks of <entity class="NE" id=6130>Stannis</entity> 's fleet destroyed by the wildfire , asserting that her presence might have turned the tide of battle . She questions <entity class="NE" id=6050>Gendry</entity> and is surprised to learn he is unaware of his father 's real identity . As they pass by the <entity class="NE" id=6132>Red Keep</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6049>Melisandre</entity> reveals to Gendry that he is King <entity class="NE" id=6134>Robert Baratheon</entity> 's bastard son . In The <entity class="NE" id=6135>North</entity> , on their way to the <entity class="NE" id=6053>Wall</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6137>Bran Stark</entity> 's party makes camp . <entity class="NE" id=6138>Osha</entity> remains distrustful of <entity class="NE" id=6139>Meera</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6140>Jojen Reed</entity> and reacts with horror when they mention they intend to go beyond the <entity class="NE" id=6053>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6138>Osha</entity> bluntly refuses to go , explaining that she lost her husband , who then rose from the dead and tried to kill her . She rages that none of them understand what lies beyond the <entity class="NE" id=6053>Wall</entity> and that there is nothing left for men there . At the camp of the <entity class="NE" id=6144>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6145>Arya</entity> , disillusioned with the <entity class="NE" id=6146>Brotherhood</entity> for selling <entity class="NE" id=6050>Gendry</entity> , takes an opportunity to escape and runs off into the night . Before she gets too far , however , she is snatched up by <entity class="NE" id=6148>Sandor Clegane</entity> , who was lying in wait for her . In the <entity class="NE" id=6124>Riverlands</entity> , en route to The <entity class="NE" id=6150>Twins</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6151>Robb Stark</entity> 's army is forced to make camp , their progress delayed by heavy rain . <entity class="NE" id=6152>Catelyn</entity> warns them that the prickly <entity class="NE" id=6153>Lord Walder Frey</entity> will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him , but <entity class="NE" id=6154>Edmure Tully</entity> points out that <entity class="NE" id=6155>Frey</entity> is getting the wedding he wanted ; his sister counters that he is getting a wedding , but not the one he wanted , glaring at her son and his wife as she says so , pointing out that <entity class="NE" id=6155>Frey</entity> wanted one of his daughters wed to a king . <entity class="NE" id=6156>Robb</entity> retorts that <entity class="NE" id=6157>Edmure</entity> is the best match <entity class="HSE" id=6158>House Frey</entity> has been offered in its history . Later that night , as <entity class="NE" id=6156>Robb</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6160>Talisa</entity> prepare for bed , she tells him she is pregnant with his child . <entity class="NE" id=6156>Robb</entity> is gladdened by the news . At his prison , <entity class="NE" id=6162>Theon Greyjoy</entity> is released from the cross to which he is chained by two beautiful girls . The women lay Theon down on a bed and then proceed to dramatically seduce him . They say repeatedly that they have heard that the heir to <entity class="NE" id=6163>Pyke</entity> is well endowed and are hoping to get first hand experience . <entity class="NE" id=6164>Theon</entity> is distrustful at first , fearing that this is another of his tormenter 's tricks . Theon can not help himself but be aroused when one of the women who has become naked straddles him and begins a rocking motion . Suddenly , the familiar horn sounds and the boy enters . <entity class="NE" id=6164>Theon</entity> is terrified and tries to escape , but is struck hard on the head and is flung to the ground . The boy claims he too has heard about Theon's famous body part and announces it must very well be his favorite body part . When the sadistic youth brandishes an odd knife , <entity class="NE" id=6164>Theon</entity> realizes the boy means to remove his penis . <entity class="NE" id=6167>Horrified</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6164>Theon</entity> begs for mercy , but the boy quips that this is mercy as he 's not killing Theon , merely altering him . Two large men hold a screaming Theon down while the boy moves in to castrate him . At <entity class="NE" id=6127>King</entity> 's Landing , neither <entity class="NE" id=6045>Sansa</entity> or Tyrion are particularly happy about their impending marriage . <entity class="NE" id=6171>Margaery Margaery</entity> consoles <entity class="NE" id=6045>Sansa</entity> , reminding her that Tyrion is far from the worst Lannister and that Tyrion might be able to make her happy , given his skill as a lover . <entity class="NE" id=6173>Bronn</entity> , meanwhile , points out to Tyrion that he can easily wed <entity class="NE" id=6045>Sansa</entity> and get a son and heir from her to placate his father and keep having sex with <entity class="NE" id=6046>Shae</entity> in private , thereby getting two women and a kingdom to rule for himself . However , <entity class="NE" id=6047>Tyrion</entity> is concerned his mistress is n't going to be so willing to go along with that plan and is less than enthusiastic about having a wife , a mistress and the entire <entity class="NE" id=6135>North</entity> despising him . <entity class="NE" id=6173>Bronn</entity> points out that Tyrion is wasting his time trying to be universally loved . <entity class="NE" id=6047>Tyrion</entity> 's fears prove accurate as <entity class="NE" id=6046>Shae</entity> bluntly tells him that she will no longer sleep with him after he weds <entity class="NE" id=6045>Sansa</entity> . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=6182>Tywin Lannister</entity> enters the throne room to answer a summons from King <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> . After exchanging some false courtesy <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> asks why his grandson wished to see him . <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> wants an update on what the <entity class="NE" id=6186>Small Council</entity> has been doing . <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> informs Joffrey that the king can attend any <entity class="NE" id=6186>Small Council</entity> meeting should he desire it . The boy king claims that he is too busy to attend said meetings and demands to know why the location of the council meetings has changed . <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> says that he is holding the meeting in the Tower of the <entity class="NE" id=6190>Hand</entity> to save time . When <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> complains that he would have to climb too many steps should he wish to sit in on a small council meeting , <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> silently ascends the steps to stand next to the throne , silently glares down at <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> , and then sardonically says he could arrange to have <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> carried . A disconcerted <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> changes the subject to <entity class="NE" id=6194>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> ; <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> is surprised that <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> even knows about the exiled princess . <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> admits the reports are apparently true that the last Targaryen is not only alive , but has successfully hatched the first live dragons the world has seen in almost two centuries . <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> is puzzled at why <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> does n't think they should do anything about her , but <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> reminds <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> that the last Targaryen dragons were stunted inbred creatures who were n't a threat to anyone , and <entity class="NE" id=6080>Daenerys</entity> ' dragons are probably just curiosities at best , not grand weapons of war . Moreover , <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> says that even if <entity class="NE" id=6080>Daenerys</entity> ' dragons do turn out to be as strong as the dragons of centuries long ago , they are on the far side of the world and no threat to <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> 's rule . <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> also warns his grandson that he should heed his advisor 's council on matters he does not comprehend . When <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> protests that he has n't been counseled on anything , <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> says he is being advised at this very moment and says that he will inform <entity class="NE" id=6183>Joffrey</entity> should he deem it necessary . Before taking his leave <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> smiles slightly with an even slighter bow leaving a browbeaten Joffrey squirming on the <entity class="NE" id=6207>Iron Throne</entity> . Their exchange leaves no doubt as to who is really ruling the kingdom . At <entity class="NE" id=6052>Harrenhal</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> speaks one last time to <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> before he leaves . <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> remarks that he owes <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> a debt for both keeping him alive on their journey and for giving him a reason to live to rouse him from his suicidal depression after losing his hand . <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> to repay his debt by keeping his pledge . <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> promises that he will keep his word to return <entity class="NE" id=6216>Catelyn Stark</entity> 's daughters to her . The next day , <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> leaves <entity class="NE" id=6052>Harrenhal</entity> in the company of <entity class="NE" id=6219>Qyburn</entity> ( who is to accompany <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> to continue treating his arm in the hopes of getting his <entity class="NE" id=6220>Maester</entity> 's chain restored through <entity class="NE" id=6221>Lord Tywin</entity> 's influence- Jaime jokes that his father will make <entity class="NE" id=6222>Qyburn Grand Maester</entity> if he grows Jaime a new hand ) and a number of <entity class="NE" id=6223>Bolton</entity> soldiers under the command of <entity class="NE" id=6224>Steelshanks</entity> , one of <entity class="NE" id=6225>Lord Bolton's</entity> captains . <entity class="NE" id=6226>Lord Lord</entity> , who is also about to depart <entity class="NE" id=6052>Harrenhal</entity> for the <entity class="NE" id=6150>Twins</entity> , under orders from <entity class="NE" id=6151>Robb Stark</entity> , requests that <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> pass on his regards to <entity class="NE" id=6048>Tywin</entity> ; Jaime asks that <entity class="NE" id=6223>Bolton</entity> do the same for him with <entity class="NE" id=6156>Robb</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=6234>Locke</entity> , who has been left in charge of the castle in <entity class="NE" id=6223>Bolton</entity> 's absence , ca n't resist poking fun at the departing Jaime and sneers that he will 'take good care ' of <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> , though <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> does n't rise to the bait . When their party makes camp , as <entity class="NE" id=6219>Qyburn</entity> checks <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> 's stump , <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> questions how the former <entity class="NE" id=6220>Maester</entity> lost his chain . <entity class="NE" id=6219>Qyburn</entity> explains that he lost it for performing vivisections on the sick and dying in a bid to better understand illness . <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> is disgusted by this revelation , but <entity class="NE" id=6219>Qyburn</entity> counters what he learned has saved numerous more lives and questions Jaime on how many he has killed compared to how many he 's saved . <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> responds that he has probably killed thousands , but he saved half a million lives when he killed the <entity class="NE" id=6245>Mad King</entity> to save the population of <entity class="NE" id=6127>King</entity> 's Landing , much to <entity class="NE" id=6219>Qyburn</entity> 's surprise . Jaime then asks about <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> ; <entity class="NE" id=6219>Qyburn</entity> confirms that they sent a raven to her father , <entity class="NE" id=6250>Lord Selwyn Tarth</entity> , and he offered a ransom of 300 <entity class="NE" id=6251>Gold Dragons</entity> for his daughter 's safe return . However , <entity class="NE" id=6234>Locke</entity> refused the offer ; still under the misapprehension that <entity class="NE" id=6253>Tarth</entity> owns every sapphire mine in <entity class="NE" id=6082>Westeros</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6234>Locke</entity> is convinced <entity class="NE" id=6255>Lord Selwyn</entity> is trying to cheat him . When <entity class="NE" id=6219>Qyburn</entity> mentions that most of the men would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> before they die in battle or winter , <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> , feeling guilty because his lie to protect <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> has invertantly placed her in greater danger , urges <entity class="NE" id=6224>Steelshanks</entity> to return to <entity class="NE" id=6052>Harrenhal</entity> . Though the man initially refuses , <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> uses the promise of a reward and the threat of <entity class="NE" id=6182>Tywin Lannister</entity> 's retribution to convince him to go back . Upon arriving at <entity class="NE" id=6052>Harrenhal</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> is shocked and furious to find <entity class="NE" id=6234>Locke</entity> and his cronies have thrown <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> into a bear pit , facing an angry bear with only a wooden sword to defend herself , as they all mockingly sing The <entity class="NE" id=6267>Bear</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=6268>Maiden Fair</entity> . Jaime orders <entity class="NE" id=6234>Locke</entity> to pull her out and offers to pay whatever ransom he wants , but <entity class="NE" id=6234>Locke</entity> dismisses the offer , getting more satisfaction out of the spectacle of <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> being torn apart . In desperation , <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> leaps into the pit to help her ; before the bear can harm either of them , <entity class="NE" id=6224>Steelshanks</entity> shoots it with a crossbow , distracting the beast long enough for <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> to be pulled out of the pit . <entity class="NE" id=6234>Locke</entity> tries to stop them from leaving , but <entity class="NE" id=6209>Jaime</entity> angrily tells him that <entity class="NE" id=6276>Lord Bolton</entity> cares more about getting him back to <entity class="NE" id=6127>King</entity> 's Landing alive than keeping one of his pet thugs happy , and backed up by <entity class="NE" id=6224>Steelshanks</entity> and his men , <entity class="NE" id=6234>Locke</entity> is unable to stop them . Jaime then departs <entity class="NE" id=6052>Harrenhal</entity> with his escort and <entity class="NE" id=6051>Brienne</entity> in tow .
