<entity class="NE" id=4013>Sansa Sansa</entity> is introduced to <entity class="NE" id=4014>Olenna Tyrell</entity> and is incautious when questioned about King <entity class="NE" id=4015>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4016>Shae</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=4017>Tyrion Lannister</entity> for help protecting <entity class="NE" id=4018>Sansa</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4019>Jaime Jaime</entity> provokes <entity class="NE" id=4020>Brienne</entity> into a duel but finds himself recaptured . <entity class="NE" id=4021>Arya Arya</entity> crosses paths with the <entity class="NE" id=4022>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> and is recognized by their new prisoner <entity class="NE" id=4023>Sandor Clegane</entity> . Ravens bring dark news to the King in the <entity class="NE" id=4024>North</entity> at <entity class="NE" id=4025>Harrenhal</entity> ; his brothers are still missing and <entity class="NE" id=4026>Hoster Tully</entity> has died . <entity class="NE" id=4027>Jon Jon</entity> learns about wargs from the <entity class="NE" id=4028>Free Folk</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4029>Bran Bran</entity> is surprised to meet new allies in the barren <entity class="NE" id=4030>North</entity> . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=4031>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4032>Jon Jon</entity> marches slowly <entity class="NE" id=4033>South</entity> with the <entity class="NE" id=4034>Free Folk</entity> army of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder . <entity class="NE" id=4035>Mance</entity> explains that his army is a diverse force , formed of about ninety different groups or clans of wildlings , who speak seven different languages , and have numerous internal rivalries . However , he managed to unite them all by telling them the truth : that they will all die if they remain north of the <entity class="NE" id=4036>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4037>Mance</entity> brings <entity class="NE" id=4038>Jon</entity> to one of his scouts , <entity class="NE" id=4039>Orell</entity> . He is sitting silently with his eyes rolled back as an eagle circles above him . <entity class="NE" id=4040>Mance</entity> says that he is a `` warg '' , and <entity class="NE" id=4041>Ygritte</entity> is surprised that <entity class="NE" id=4042>Jon</entity> does n't know what that is . <entity class="NE" id=4043>Mance</entity> explains that a warg is a person who is capable of entering the mind of an animal , seeing what it sees and even controlling its actions . <entity class="NE" id=4044>Orell</entity> controls his menagerie to scout miles ahead . <entity class="NE" id=4045>Mance</entity> asks him what he has seen , and <entity class="NE" id=4046>Orell</entity> says he saw the <entity class="NE" id=4047>Fist</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4048>First Men</entity> - and many dead `` crows '' . <entity class="NE" id=4049>Mormont</entity> assigns <entity class="NE" id=4050>Rast</entity> care of <entity class="NE" id=4051>Tarly</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4052>Lord Lord</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4053>Night's Watch</entity> leads the few survivors of the slaughter at the <entity class="NE" id=4054>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4055>Fist</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4056>First Men</entity> south in hope of reaching the <entity class="NE" id=4057>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4058>Samwell Samwell</entity> is exhausted and collapses . <entity class="NE" id=4059>Rast</entity> is annoyed that <entity class="NE" id=4060>Sam</entity> hid during the battle , and thinks they should leave him because he 's slowing them down . <entity class="NE" id=4061>Sam</entity> is upset that <entity class="NE" id=4062>Grenn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4063>Edd</entity> abandoned him at the start of the attack , although they refuse to leave him now . <entity class="NE" id=4064>Mormont</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=4065>Sam</entity> that he has to keep moving , and sternly forbids <entity class="NE" id=4065>Sam</entity> to die . <entity class="NE" id=4066>Mormont</entity> orders <entity class="NE" id=4067>Rast</entity> to keep <entity class="NE" id=4068>Sam</entity> alive until they reach the <entity class="NE" id=4069>Wall</entity> on pain of death . In the <entity class="NE" id=4070>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4071>Bran Bran</entity> dreams that he is walking and hunting in the woods ; he sees the mysterious three-eyed raven again . As he aims his bow , he relives his memories of when he was practicing archery with <entity class="NE" id=4072>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4073>Robb</entity> , and hears the voice of his father <entity class="NE" id=4074>Eddard</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4075>Bran</entity> shoots at the raven but misses . A young stranger appears . The boy tells <entity class="NE" id=4076>Bran</entity> that he can not shoot the raven , because he is the raven . <entity class="NE" id=4077>Bran</entity> awakens suddenly , worrying <entity class="NE" id=4078>Hodor</entity> for a moment but he says that he is fine . <entity class="NE" id=4079>Osha</entity> says they have enough problems without dark dreams . <entity class="NE" id=4080>Bran</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4081>Rickon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4082>Osha</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4083>Hodor</entity> , and the direwolves Summer and <entity class="NE" id=4084>Shaggydog</entity> continue to head north from <entity class="NE" id=4085>Winterfell</entity> to the <entity class="NE" id=4086>Wall</entity> . Later , the same boy from the dream approaches their camp in the woods unarmed . Summer snarls at him initially but then sniffs his hand and turns away . <entity class="NE" id=4087>Osha</entity> comes up behind the boy with a sharpened wooden spear , only for the boy 's sister to surprise <entity class="NE" id=4087>Osha</entity> and put a knife to her throat . The boy introduces himself as <entity class="NE" id=4088>Jojen Reed</entity> , and his sister as <entity class="NE" id=4089>Meera Reed</entity> . <entity class="HSE" id=4090>House Reed</entity> are loyal bannermen of <entity class="HSE" id=4091>House Stark</entity> , and they have been searching for <entity class="NE" id=4092>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4093>Rickon</entity> so that they can protect them . When they are on the move again , <entity class="NE" id=4094>Jojen</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4095>Bran</entity> discuss his wolf-dreams . <entity class="NE" id=4096>Jojen</entity> explains that <entity class="NE" id=4097>Bran</entity> himself is a warg . <entity class="NE" id=4098>Jojen</entity> says that it starts out as vivid dreams seeing the world through his wolf 's eyes , but with practice he will be able to consciously enter the mind of his wolf and control its actions . <entity class="NE" id=4099>Bran</entity> asks if prophetic dreams are part of being a warg , but <entity class="NE" id=4100>Jojen</entity> explains that 's a different , related ability . `` The Sight '' allows those who possess it to see events that have n't happened yet , or events that happened long before they were born , or events happening now but thousands of miles away . <entity class="NE" id=4101>Jojen</entity> confirms that <entity class="NE" id=4102>Bran</entity> 's dream of his father Eddard the day he died was an example of the <entity class="NE" id=4103>Sight</entity> , and that <entity class="NE" id=4101>Jojen</entity> himself had a similar dream the same day . He says that when he told his father , <entity class="NE" id=4104>Lord Howland Reed</entity> , he openly wept , for he correctly realized that his son 's dream signified that <entity class="NE" id=4105>Eddard</entity> was dead . <entity class="NE" id=4106>Bran</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=4107>Howland</entity> was a great friend of his father <entity class="NE" id=4108>Eddard</entity> 's who fought alongside him during <entity class="NE" id=4109>Robert</entity> 's Rebellion . <entity class="NE" id=4110>Jojen</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=4111>Howland</entity> does n't like to talk about the war much . <entity class="NE" id=4112>Jojen</entity> confirms that <entity class="NE" id=4113>Bran</entity> was n't simply experiencing a vision of <entity class="NE" id=4112>Jojen</entity> in his earlier dream , but that he reached out with his mind to contact <entity class="NE" id=4113>Bran</entity> in his dream , and that he remembers seeing the three-eyed raven too . At an indeterminate location , <entity class="NE" id=4114>Theon Greyjoy</entity> has been chained up in a dungeon after being knocked out before the Sack of <entity class="NE" id=4115>Winterfell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4116>Men</entity> come in , some wearing ironborn clothing , and interrogate him . When he asks what they want , one of his captors says he wants to do `` this '' and starts prying his fingernails off with a knife . Later they use a foot press to torture him , while also slowly turning a screw into his foot until it is bleeding freely , repeatedly asking him why he captured <entity class="NE" id=4117>Winterfell</entity> , but apparently not caring about the answers he gives . Theon at first tells them the simple truth that he wanted to take and hold <entity class="NE" id=4118>Winterfell</entity> while the <entity class="NE" id=4119>North</entity> was vunerable to impress his father , then starts frantically lying , saying he hates the <entity class="NE" id=4120>Starks</entity> and is their enemy , desperately trying to figure out what his captors want him to tell them . When the guards leave they put a bag over his head . A servant boy comes over to Theon and unwinds the foot press , and tells him that he has been sent by his sister <entity class="NE" id=4121>Yara</entity> to rescue him . However , he must wait until nightfall when the castle is asleep , so he puts the bag back on and the desperate Theon is left alone crying for help . King <entity class="NE" id=4122>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> is being fitted for new clothes in his chambers , in preparation for his upcoming wedding to <entity class="NE" id=4123>Margaery Tyrell</entity> . His mother <entity class="NE" id=4124>Cersei</entity> begins to criticize <entity class="NE" id=4125>Margaery</entity> , saying that she is only charitable to the poor to build up support for herself , and also saying that she thinks she dresses like a harlot . However , <entity class="NE" id=4126>Joffrey</entity> barely tolerates his mother 's chiding and dismissively tells her off . <entity class="NE" id=4127>Shae</entity> dresses <entity class="NE" id=4128>Sansa Stark</entity> in her chambers , and warns <entity class="NE" id=4129>Sansa</entity> about <entity class="NE" id=4130>Petyr</entity> `` Littlefinger '' <entity class="NE" id=4131>Baelish</entity> . She points out that <entity class="NE" id=4132>Baelish</entity> has offered to help <entity class="NE" id=4133>Sansa</entity> for nothing in return , which probably means that he 's after something . <entity class="NE" id=4134>Sansa</entity> naively says that he 's an old friend of her mother 's , believing that should be reason enough . <entity class="NE" id=4135>Shae</entity> suggests that <entity class="NE" id=4136>Baelish</entity> is actually sexually attracted to <entity class="NE" id=4137>Sansa</entity> . This disturbs <entity class="NE" id=4138>Sansa</entity> , but she thinks it is simply impossible , as <entity class="NE" id=4139>Baelish</entity> is so much older than her . <entity class="NE" id=4140>Shae</entity> continues to warn <entity class="NE" id=4141>Sansa</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=4142>Baelish</entity> is manipulative and men usually only want `` one thing '' from pretty young ladies , and `` love '' often is n't what they 're after . <entity class="NE" id=4143>Sansa</entity> warns the <entity class="NE" id=4144>Tyrells</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=4145>Joffrey</entity> is a monster . Ser Ser arrives at the door and escorts <entity class="NE" id=4146>Sansa</entity> to the gardens to meet with <entity class="NE" id=4147>Margaery</entity> and their grandmother , <entity class="NE" id=4148>Lady Olenna Tyrell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4149>Sansa</entity> reminds Loras that they met once before at the <entity class="NE" id=4150>Tourney</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4151>Hand</entity> , and he takes his leave after introducing her . <entity class="NE" id=4152>Lady Lady</entity> is a cunning and intelligent woman who speaks her mind , and bluntly says that her son <entity class="NE" id=4153>Mace</entity> was a fool for supporting <entity class="NE" id=4154>Renly Baratheon</entity> 's claim to the throne , though <entity class="NE" id=4155>Margaery</entity> speaks well of <entity class="NE" id=4156>Renly</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4157>Lady Lady</entity> insists that <entity class="NE" id=4158>Sansa</entity> tell her the truth about what <entity class="NE" id=4159>Joffrey</entity> is like , as he is to marry <entity class="NE" id=4160>Margaery</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4161>Sansa</entity> is initially reluctant , but when <entity class="NE" id=4162>Olenna</entity> mentions her father , <entity class="NE" id=4161>Sansa</entity> breaks down and , her eyes blazing , angrily recounts how <entity class="NE" id=4163>Joffrey</entity> had said he would show her father mercy , only to behead him in front of her , and how he then took her up to the wall and forced her to look at her father 's head on a spike and claim him providing her father with a swift death was `` mercy '' . Realizing what she has just been saying , <entity class="NE" id=4164>Sansa</entity> nervously attempts to backtrack . <entity class="NE" id=4165>Olenna</entity> continues to prod <entity class="NE" id=4166>Sansa</entity> as she fidgets around , and it becomes obvious that she is visibly afraid about being overheard . After enough times of <entity class="NE" id=4167>Olenna</entity> insisting that she can trust her not to repeat what she says , <entity class="NE" id=4168>Sansa</entity> blurts out that <entity class="NE" id=4169>Joffrey</entity> is `` a monster '' . <entity class="NE" id=4170>Olenna</entity> is disappointed , but unsurprised , given the rumors that have been circulating about <entity class="NE" id=4171>Joffrey</entity> 's public outbursts . <entity class="NE" id=4172>Sansa</entity> is worried that this means the <entity class="NE" id=4173>Tyrells</entity> will cancel their proposed marriage alliance ( meaning <entity class="NE" id=4172>Sansa</entity> will be stuck with <entity class="NE" id=4174>Joffrey</entity> again ) , but <entity class="NE" id=4175>Olenna</entity> assures her that her son <entity class="NE" id=4176>Mace</entity> is too intent on Margaery entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything . <entity class="NE" id=4177>Shae</entity> sneaks into <entity class="NE" id=4178>Tyrion Lannister</entity> 's new chambers . He warns her that his father threatened to kill her if he found her with him again , and that his father follows through on such threats . <entity class="NE" id=4179>Undeterred</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4180>Shae</entity> starts undressing <entity class="NE" id=4181>Tyrion</entity> , and asks him for a favor ; to protect <entity class="NE" id=4182>Sansa</entity> from <entity class="NE" id=4183>Baelish</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4184>Tyrion</entity> says that he no longer has enough power or influence to attempt to do that , though <entity class="NE" id=4185>Shae</entity> accuses him of being attracted to <entity class="NE" id=4186>Sansa</entity> , which he cheerfully denies . It also comes out that <entity class="NE" id=4187>Tyrion</entity> had sex with <entity class="NE" id=4188>Ros</entity> back in the <entity class="NE" id=4189>North</entity> , though <entity class="NE" id=4187>Tyrion</entity> points out it was before he met <entity class="NE" id=4190>Shae</entity> . They playfully bicker about it as they start having sex . <entity class="NE" id=4191>Margaery</entity> finds a way to bond with <entity class="NE" id=4192>Joffrey</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4193>Margaery</entity> is summoned to <entity class="NE" id=4194>Joffrey</entity> 's chambers to see if she needs anything before he leaves on a hunting trip . While <entity class="NE" id=4195>Joffrey</entity> has previously been easy for <entity class="NE" id=4196>Margaery</entity> to manipulate , <entity class="NE" id=4197>Cersei</entity> was apparently able to plant one seed of doubt in his mind ; the fact that <entity class="NE" id=4196>Margaery</entity> was married to his uncle <entity class="NE" id=4198>Renly</entity> ( and thus , already had sex with another man ) , whom <entity class="NE" id=4197>Cersei</entity> described as a `` traitor and known degenerate '' . When questioned , <entity class="NE" id=4199>Margaery</entity> says that she was ordered to marry a traitor as her family duty , but <entity class="NE" id=4200>Joffrey</entity> implies that this still means he must have had sex with her . <entity class="NE" id=4201>Joffrey</entity> angrily questions Margaery about the relationship and she delicately placates him by feigning demure shyness and painting herself as a dutiful , but frustrated , bride . She uses the rumors about <entity class="NE" id=4202>Renly</entity> 's homosexuality to redirect <entity class="NE" id=4203>Joffrey</entity> 's anger , stating that <entity class="NE" id=4202>Renly</entity> always found excuses to avoid sex , but , in one instance , drunkenly suggested `` something that sounded very painful and could not possibly result in children '' , which draws her new fiance 's sympathy . <entity class="NE" id=4204>Margaery</entity> eventually manages to divert attention to the new custom crossbow <entity class="NE" id=4205>Joffrey</entity> 's had made for his excursion . It quickly becomes apparent that <entity class="NE" id=4206>Joffrey</entity> is excited by violence and sadism , so she flirts with him by complimenting the crossbow and musing about killing something herself . Easily played , <entity class="NE" id=4207>Joffrey</entity> offers to take her with him to share in the excitement of killing something . King <entity class="NE" id=4208>Robb Stark</entity> settles into the council chamber at <entity class="NE" id=4209>Harrenhal</entity> with his wife <entity class="NE" id=4210>Queen Talisa</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4211>Lord Lord</entity> interrupts them with two messenger-raven missives , each of which brings bad news . First , <entity class="NE" id=4212>Robb</entity> 's maternal grandfather <entity class="NE" id=4213>Hoster Tully</entity> has finally died after a long illness at his castle of <entity class="NE" id=4214>Riverrun</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4215>Second</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4216>Roose</entity> delivers a letter from his bastard son <entity class="NE" id=4217>Ramsay Snow</entity> , stating that the ironborn torched <entity class="NE" id=4218>Winterfell</entity> and put all of its inhabitants to the sword , and then fled all before his force arrived there . There has been no sighting of <entity class="NE" id=4219>Bran</entity> or <entity class="NE" id=4220>Rickon</entity> , and though <entity class="NE" id=4221>Robb</entity> hopes that they are still alive , there is a strong possibility that they are dead . Moreover , there has been no word of <entity class="NE" id=4222>Theon</entity> , and if he took the boys captive the <entity class="NE" id=4223>Greyjoys</entity> have n't sent out any demands . This double-blow reduces <entity class="NE" id=4224>Catelyn Stark</entity> to tears and she laments that she had not seen her father in years . She is horrified at the thought that <entity class="NE" id=4225>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4226>Rickon</entity> were in danger while she was away and could not protect them , and are now likely dead . <entity class="NE" id=4227>Robb</entity> leaves <entity class="NE" id=4228>Roose</entity> in command of <entity class="NE" id=4229>Harrenhal</entity> with a detachment of the <entity class="NE" id=4230>Northern</entity> army while <entity class="NE" id=4227>Robb</entity> leads his main host back across the <entity class="NE" id=4231>Riverlands</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=4232>Riverrun</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4233>Lord Lord</entity> angrily says that this is a waste of time , though <entity class="NE" id=4234>Robb</entity> points out that <entity class="NE" id=4235>Catelyn</entity> 's brother and his uncle , <entity class="NE" id=4236>Edmure Tully</entity> , is now lord of <entity class="NE" id=4237>Riverrun</entity> and his levies will reinforce their army . <entity class="NE" id=4238>Karstark</entity> maintains that unless <entity class="NE" id=4239>Edmure</entity> has been breeding soldiers like rabbits , it will make no difference : with their new <entity class="NE" id=4240>Tyrell</entity> allies , the Lannisters now outnumber them over two to one . <entity class="NE" id=4241>Robb</entity> asks if <entity class="NE" id=4242>Karstark</entity> has lost faith in their cause , and <entity class="NE" id=4242>Karstark</entity> says he still believes in revenge . However , the fact that <entity class="NE" id=4243>Robb</entity> lost his home castle makes him seem vulnerable in the eyes of his bannermen , and many no longer believe in <entity class="NE" id=4243>Robb</entity> as they once did . <entity class="NE" id=4244>Lord Lord</entity> asks to speak his mind ( as if he was n't already ) , and says that he thinks <entity class="NE" id=4245>Robb</entity> lost the war the day he married <entity class="NE" id=4246>Talisa</entity> , a political nobody , throwing away any opportunity to forge marriage-alliances with badly needed allies , specifically breaking his promise to enter into a marriage-alliance with <entity class="HSE" id=4247>House Frey</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4248>Talisa</entity> notices that <entity class="NE" id=4249>Catelyn</entity> is making a prayer wheel for the <entity class="NE" id=4250>Faith</entity> of the Seven , and offers to help . <entity class="NE" id=4251>Catelyn</entity> explains that they can only be made by mothers who are praying for the welfare of their children . <entity class="NE" id=4252>Catelyn</entity> reveals that she has only made them twice before , one of which was when she was praying for <entity class="NE" id=4253>Bran</entity> to wake from his coma , which worked after a fashion , as he did survive though he lost the use of his legs . <entity class="NE" id=4254>Talisa</entity> asks after the other time , and <entity class="NE" id=4255>Catelyn</entity> says that when they were younger , one of the boys had a pox , and <entity class="NE" id=4256>Maester Luwin</entity> said that if he survived the night he would be all right , but that it would be a long night . <entity class="NE" id=4257>Catelyn</entity> explains that the boy was <entity class="NE" id=4258>Jon Snow</entity> , and at first the thought that <entity class="NE" id=4259>Jon</entity> would conveniently die of natural causes made her inwardly pray to the Seven for his end . However , <entity class="NE" id=4260>Catelyn</entity> then became horrified at herself for thinking such a thing , particularly as <entity class="NE" id=4261>Jon</entity> was an innocent child , and the person <entity class="NE" id=4260>Catelyn</entity> really hated was <entity class="NE" id=4261>Jon</entity> 's unidentified mother . So she made a prayer wheel and stayed up with him all night , praying to the gods that if they forgave her earlier wish that <entity class="NE" id=4262>Jon</entity> would die , she promised she would urge <entity class="NE" id=4263>Eddard</entity> to have <entity class="NE" id=4262>Jon</entity> legitimized as a Stark and she would raise him as her own son . <entity class="NE" id=4264>Jon</entity> recovered , however , <entity class="NE" id=4265>Catelyn</entity> did not keep her promise . In grief at the death of her father and apparent death of her two youngest sons , and her continued grief at losing <entity class="NE" id=4266>Eddard</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4267>Catelyn</entity> says the gods are punishing her misconduct with this war . Not too far away in the <entity class="NE" id=4268>Riverlands</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4269>Arya Stark</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4270>Gendry</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=4271>Hot Pie</entity> are heading north from <entity class="NE" id=4272>Harrenhal</entity> , planning to eventually reach the <entity class="NE" id=4273>Red Fork</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=4274>Trident River</entity> and then follow it west to her grandfather 's castle-seat at <entity class="NE" id=4275>Riverrun</entity> . Off-screen , <entity class="NE" id=4276>Arya</entity> explained to the boys how <entity class="NE" id=4277>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> helped them escape because he offered that he would kill any three people she named . <entity class="NE" id=4278>Gendry</entity> loudly criticizes <entity class="NE" id=4279>Arya</entity> , in disbelief that she used up two of the names on minor Lannister guards when she could have said someone like `` King Joffrey '' or `` <entity class="NE" id=4280>Tywin Lannister</entity> '' and ended the entire war , at which <entity class="NE" id=4279>Arya</entity> gets quite defensive . However , as they advance in the forest , they run into a scouting party of the <entity class="NE" id=4281>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> , a group of outlaws , whose leader <entity class="NE" id=4282>Thoros</entity> of Myr they hear singing `` The <entity class="NE" id=4283>Rains</entity> of Castamere '' as they approach . They recognize them as the group the <entity class="NE" id=4284>Lannister</entity> torturers were asking about at <entity class="NE" id=4285>Harrenhal</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4286>Thoros</entity> seems a friendly sort , and they make the children come with them . They later give them food and drink at a local inn . <entity class="NE" id=4287>Gendry</entity> says he used to work as a smith in <entity class="NE" id=4288>King</entity> 's Landing for <entity class="NE" id=4289>Tobho Mott</entity> , whom <entity class="NE" id=4290>Thoros</entity> recognizes but says he charged double what the other smiths did ; <entity class="NE" id=4287>Gendry</entity> counters that 's because it was double the quality . <entity class="NE" id=4291>Arya</entity> insists that she knows how to use a sword despite <entity class="NE" id=4292>Thoros</entity> ' disbelief , but when she tries to mock-fence with him he quickly disarms her . Other members of the <entity class="NE" id=4293>Brotherhood</entity> return to the inn with a captive ; <entity class="NE" id=4294>Sandor</entity> `` The <entity class="NE" id=4295>Hound</entity> '' <entity class="NE" id=4296>Clegane</entity> . As <entity class="NE" id=4297>Thoros</entity> trades insults with <entity class="NE" id=4298>Sandor</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=4299>Arya</entity> tries to leave , but the <entity class="NE" id=4300>Hound</entity> stops her in astonishment and asks what in seven hells they 're doing with `` the <entity class="NE" id=4301>Stark</entity> bitch '' , revealing her identity to all . Finally , <entity class="NE" id=4302>Jaime Lannister</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4303>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=4304>Tarth</entity> are slowly making their way across country through the <entity class="NE" id=4305>Riverlands</entity> , heading to <entity class="NE" id=4306>King</entity> 's Landing intending to make the prisoner exchange for the Stark girls ( really , just <entity class="NE" id=4307>Sansa</entity> ) . Jaime continues to mock <entity class="NE" id=4308>Brienne</entity> along the way . <entity class="NE" id=4309>Brienne</entity> is wary enough not to let Jaime out of her sight , even insisting on keeping him on his leash and watching while he urinates so he does n't slip away . <entity class="NE" id=4310>Jaime</entity> deduces that <entity class="NE" id=4311>Brienne</entity> is n't from the <entity class="NE" id=4312>North</entity> because he would have noticed her at <entity class="NE" id=4313>Winterfell</entity> when he visited there , so ( as she is from <entity class="HSE" id=4314>House Tarth</entity> ) she must be a <entity class="NE" id=4315>Baratheon</entity> supporter . She angrily denies supporting <entity class="NE" id=4316>Stannis</entity> , thus confirming that she served Renly . Jaime accurately deduces that she fancied Renly , but points out that <entity class="NE" id=4317>Renly</entity> was n't attracted to women so much as he was to <entity class="NE" id=4318>Loras</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4319>Brienne</entity> says she does n't want to hear his filthy lies , but he says that he knew Renly better than she did , reminding her that both of them spent the last 17 years living in the <entity class="NE" id=4320>Red Keep</entity> , ever since <entity class="NE" id=4321>Robert</entity> 's Rebellion when <entity class="NE" id=4322>Renly</entity> was just a child prancing down the halls . Jaime insists that <entity class="NE" id=4323>Renly</entity> 's homosexuality was actually `` the worst kept secret at court '' if she thinks he 's lying . He continues to casually mock Renly which makes <entity class="NE" id=4324>Brienne</entity> grab him , but he relents and says he does n't particularly care that Renly loved <entity class="NE" id=4325>Loras</entity> , as he feels people are n't free to choose the ones they love ( which he knows better than most ) . They come across a farmer with a heavily laden mule , who notices that they 're cutting cross-country and avoiding the major roads , and suspects that they 're avoiding soldiers . <entity class="NE" id=4326>Jaime</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=4327>Brienne</entity> that he suspects the man is a scout meant to intercept them , and even if he is n't he can still spread word he saw them . He urges her to kill the man , but she refuses . <entity class="NE" id=4328>Brienne</entity> gives Jaime a beatdown . Later , the pair have to cross a river , which means they can either attempt a dangerous fording or take the bridge , which will probably be watched . <entity class="NE" id=4329>Brienne</entity> takes the safer route of the bridge , but <entity class="NE" id=4330>Jaime</entity> manages to distract her long enough to take away her spare sword and cut his bonds . <entity class="NE" id=4331>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=4332>Jaime</entity> enter into an extended sword fight on the bridge . <entity class="NE" id=4333>Jaime</entity> starts off very aggressively , putting <entity class="NE" id=4334>Brienne</entity> on the defensive . However , <entity class="NE" id=4335>Jaime</entity> 's mobility is reduced because his hands are still manacled , and he is malnourished after having spent the past full year chained up in a cell . Jaime begins to tire , and <entity class="NE" id=4336>Brienne</entity> wears him down further by making body-blows with kicks and punches . After a protracted fight Jaime finally slumps to the ground in exhaustion . Just then , riders from <entity class="HSE" id=4337>House Bolton</entity> arrive led by a man named <entity class="NE" id=4338>Locke</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=4339>Jaime</entity> asks if they want to negotiate , but <entity class="NE" id=4340>Locke</entity> says they 'll have his head if he does n't bring the <entity class="NE" id=4341>Kingslayer</entity> back to the King in the <entity class="NE" id=4342>North</entity> , so there 's not much Jaime can do to dissuade him from taking them prisoner .
