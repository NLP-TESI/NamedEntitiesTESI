<entity id=4040>Sansa Sansa</entity> is introduced to <entity id=4041>Olenna Tyrell</entity> and is incautious when questioned about King <entity id=4042>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> . <entity id=4043>Shae</entity> asks <entity id=4044>Tyrion Lannister</entity> for help protecting <entity id=4045>Sansa</entity> . <entity id=4046>Jaime Jaime</entity> provokes <entity id=4047>Brienne</entity> into a duel but finds himself recaptured . <entity id=4048>Arya Arya</entity> crosses paths with the <entity id=4049>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> and is recognized by their new prisoner <entity id=4050>Sandor Clegane</entity> . Ravens bring dark news to the King in the <entity id=4051>North</entity> at <entity id=4052>Harrenhal</entity> ; his brothers are still missing and <entity id=4053>Hoster Tully</entity> has died . <entity id=4054>Jon Jon</entity> learns about wargs from the <entity id=4055>Free Folk</entity> . <entity id=4056>Bran Bran</entity> is surprised to meet new allies in the barren <entity id=4057>North</entity> . Beyond the <entity id=4058>Wall</entity> . <entity id=4059>Jon Jon</entity> marches slowly <entity id=4060>South</entity> with the <entity id=4061>Free Folk</entity> army of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder . <entity id=4062>Mance</entity> explains that his army is a diverse force , formed of about ninety different groups or clans of wildlings , who speak seven different languages , and have numerous internal rivalries . However , he managed to unite them all by telling them the truth : that they will all die if they remain north of the <entity id=4063>Wall</entity> . <entity id=4064>Mance</entity> brings <entity id=4065>Jon</entity> to one of his scouts , <entity id=4066>Orell</entity> . He is sitting silently with his eyes rolled back as an eagle circles above him . <entity id=4067>Mance</entity> says that he is a `` warg '' , and <entity id=4068>Ygritte</entity> is surprised that <entity id=4069>Jon</entity> does n't know what that is . <entity id=4070>Mance</entity> explains that a warg is a person who is capable of entering the mind of an animal , seeing what it sees and even controlling its actions . <entity id=4071>Orell</entity> controls his menagerie to scout miles ahead . <entity id=4072>Mance</entity> asks him what he has seen , and <entity id=4073>Orell</entity> says he saw the <entity id=4074>Fist</entity> of the <entity id=4075>First Men</entity> - and many dead `` crows '' . <entity id=4076>Mormont</entity> assigns <entity id=4077>Rast</entity> care of <entity id=4078>Tarly</entity> . <entity id=4079>Lord Lord</entity> of the <entity id=4080>Night's Watch</entity> leads the few survivors of the slaughter at the <entity id=4081>Battle</entity> of the <entity id=4082>Fist</entity> of the <entity id=4083>First Men</entity> south in hope of reaching the <entity id=4084>Wall</entity> . <entity id=4085>Samwell Samwell</entity> is exhausted and collapses . <entity id=4086>Rast</entity> is annoyed that <entity id=4087>Sam</entity> hid during the battle , and thinks they should leave him because he 's slowing them down . <entity id=4088>Sam</entity> is upset that <entity id=4089>Grenn</entity> and <entity id=4090>Edd</entity> abandoned him at the start of the attack , although they refuse to leave him now . <entity id=4091>Mormont</entity> tells <entity id=4092>Sam</entity> that he has to keep moving , and sternly forbids <entity id=4092>Sam</entity> to die . <entity id=4093>Mormont</entity> orders <entity id=4094>Rast</entity> to keep <entity id=4095>Sam</entity> alive until they reach the <entity id=4096>Wall</entity> on pain of death . In the <entity id=4097>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity id=4098>Bran Bran</entity> dreams that he is walking and hunting in the woods ; he sees the mysterious three-eyed raven again . As he aims his bow , he relives his memories of when he was practicing archery with <entity id=4099>Jon</entity> and <entity id=4100>Robb</entity> , and hears the voice of his father <entity id=4101>Eddard</entity> . <entity id=4102>Bran</entity> shoots at the raven but misses . A young stranger appears . The boy tells <entity id=4103>Bran</entity> that he can not shoot the raven , because he is the raven . <entity id=4104>Bran</entity> awakens suddenly , worrying <entity id=4105>Hodor</entity> for a moment but he says that he is fine . <entity id=4106>Osha</entity> says they have enough problems without dark dreams . <entity id=4107>Bran</entity> , <entity id=4108>Rickon</entity> , <entity id=4109>Osha</entity> , <entity id=4110>Hodor</entity> , and the direwolves Summer and <entity id=4111>Shaggydog</entity> continue to head north from <entity id=4112>Winterfell</entity> to the <entity id=4113>Wall</entity> . Later , the same boy from the dream approaches their camp in the woods unarmed . Summer snarls at him initially but then sniffs his hand and turns away . <entity id=4114>Osha</entity> comes up behind the boy with a sharpened wooden spear , only for the boy 's sister to surprise <entity id=4114>Osha</entity> and put a knife to her throat . The boy introduces himself as <entity id=4115>Jojen Reed</entity> , and his sister as <entity id=4116>Meera Reed</entity> . <entity id=4117>House Reed</entity> are loyal bannermen of <entity id=4118>House Stark</entity> , and they have been searching for <entity id=4119>Bran</entity> and <entity id=4120>Rickon</entity> so that they can protect them . When they are on the move again , <entity id=4121>Jojen</entity> and <entity id=4122>Bran</entity> discuss his wolf-dreams . <entity id=4123>Jojen</entity> explains that <entity id=4124>Bran</entity> himself is a warg . <entity id=4125>Jojen</entity> says that it starts out as vivid dreams seeing the world through his wolf 's eyes , but with practice he will be able to consciously enter the mind of his wolf and control its actions . <entity id=4126>Bran</entity> asks if prophetic dreams are part of being a warg , but <entity id=4127>Jojen</entity> explains that 's a different , related ability . `` The Sight '' allows those who possess it to see events that have n't happened yet , or events that happened long before they were born , or events happening now but thousands of miles away . <entity id=4128>Jojen</entity> confirms that <entity id=4129>Bran</entity> 's dream of his father Eddard the day he died was an example of the <entity id=4130>Sight</entity> , and that <entity id=4128>Jojen</entity> himself had a similar dream the same day . He says that when he told his father , <entity id=4131>Lord Howland Reed</entity> , he openly wept , for he correctly realized that his son 's dream signified that <entity id=4132>Eddard</entity> was dead . <entity id=4133>Bran</entity> says that <entity id=4134>Howland</entity> was a great friend of his father <entity id=4135>Eddard</entity> 's who fought alongside him during <entity id=4136>Robert</entity> 's Rebellion . <entity id=4137>Jojen</entity> says that <entity id=4138>Howland</entity> does n't like to talk about the war much . <entity id=4139>Jojen</entity> confirms that <entity id=4140>Bran</entity> was n't simply experiencing a vision of <entity id=4139>Jojen</entity> in his earlier dream , but that he reached out with his mind to contact <entity id=4140>Bran</entity> in his dream , and that he remembers seeing the three-eyed raven too . At an indeterminate location , <entity id=4141>Theon Greyjoy</entity> has been chained up in a dungeon after being knocked out before the Sack of <entity id=4142>Winterfell</entity> . <entity id=4143>Men</entity> come in , some wearing ironborn clothing , and interrogate him . When he asks what they want , one of his captors says he wants to do `` this '' and starts prying his fingernails off with a knife . Later they use a foot press to torture him , while also slowly turning a screw into his foot until it is bleeding freely , repeatedly asking him why he captured <entity id=4144>Winterfell</entity> , but apparently not caring about the answers he gives . Theon at first tells them the simple truth that he wanted to take and hold <entity id=4145>Winterfell</entity> while the <entity id=4146>North</entity> was vunerable to impress his father , then starts frantically lying , saying he hates the <entity id=4147>Starks</entity> and is their enemy , desperately trying to figure out what his captors want him to tell them . When the guards leave they put a bag over his head . A servant boy comes over to Theon and unwinds the foot press , and tells him that he has been sent by his sister <entity id=4148>Yara</entity> to rescue him . However , he must wait until nightfall when the castle is asleep , so he puts the bag back on and the desperate Theon is left alone crying for help . King <entity id=4149>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> is being fitted for new clothes in his chambers , in preparation for his upcoming wedding to <entity id=4150>Margaery Tyrell</entity> . His mother <entity id=4151>Cersei</entity> begins to criticize <entity id=4152>Margaery</entity> , saying that she is only charitable to the poor to build up support for herself , and also saying that she thinks she dresses like a harlot . However , <entity id=4153>Joffrey</entity> barely tolerates his mother 's chiding and dismissively tells her off . <entity id=4154>Shae</entity> dresses <entity id=4155>Sansa Stark</entity> in her chambers , and warns <entity id=4156>Sansa</entity> about <entity id=4157>Petyr</entity> `` Littlefinger '' <entity id=4158>Baelish</entity> . She points out that <entity id=4159>Baelish</entity> has offered to help <entity id=4160>Sansa</entity> for nothing in return , which probably means that he 's after something . <entity id=4161>Sansa</entity> naively says that he 's an old friend of her mother 's , believing that should be reason enough . <entity id=4162>Shae</entity> suggests that <entity id=4163>Baelish</entity> is actually sexually attracted to <entity id=4164>Sansa</entity> . This disturbs <entity id=4165>Sansa</entity> , but she thinks it is simply impossible , as <entity id=4166>Baelish</entity> is so much older than her . <entity id=4167>Shae</entity> continues to warn <entity id=4168>Sansa</entity> that <entity id=4169>Baelish</entity> is manipulative and men usually only want `` one thing '' from pretty young ladies , and `` love '' often is n't what they 're after . <entity id=4170>Sansa</entity> warns the <entity id=4171>Tyrells</entity> that <entity id=4172>Joffrey</entity> is a monster . <entity id=4173>Ser Ser</entity> arrives at the door and escorts <entity id=4174>Sansa</entity> to the gardens to meet with <entity id=4175>Margaery</entity> and their grandmother , <entity id=4176>Lady Olenna Tyrell</entity> . <entity id=4177>Sansa</entity> reminds Loras that they met once before at the <entity id=4178>Tourney</entity> of the <entity id=4179>Hand</entity> , and he takes his leave after introducing her . <entity id=4180>Lady Lady</entity> is a cunning and intelligent woman who speaks her mind , and bluntly says that her son <entity id=4181>Mace</entity> was a fool for supporting <entity id=4182>Renly Baratheon</entity> 's claim to the throne , though <entity id=4183>Margaery</entity> speaks well of <entity id=4184>Renly</entity> . <entity id=4185>Lady Lady</entity> insists that <entity id=4186>Sansa</entity> tell her the truth about what <entity id=4187>Joffrey</entity> is like , as he is to marry <entity id=4188>Margaery</entity> . <entity id=4189>Sansa</entity> is initially reluctant , but when <entity id=4190>Olenna</entity> mentions her father , <entity id=4189>Sansa</entity> breaks down and , her eyes blazing , angrily recounts how <entity id=4191>Joffrey</entity> had said he would show her father mercy , only to behead him in front of her , and how he then took her up to the wall and forced her to look at her father 's head on a spike and claim him providing her father with a swift death was `` mercy '' . Realizing what she has just been saying , <entity id=4192>Sansa</entity> nervously attempts to backtrack . <entity id=4193>Olenna</entity> continues to prod <entity id=4194>Sansa</entity> as she fidgets around , and it becomes obvious that she is visibly afraid about being overheard . After enough times of <entity id=4195>Olenna</entity> insisting that she can trust her not to repeat what she says , <entity id=4196>Sansa</entity> blurts out that <entity id=4197>Joffrey</entity> is `` a monster '' . <entity id=4198>Olenna</entity> is disappointed , but unsurprised , given the rumors that have been circulating about <entity id=4199>Joffrey</entity> 's public outbursts . <entity id=4200>Sansa</entity> is worried that this means the <entity id=4201>Tyrells</entity> will cancel their proposed marriage alliance ( meaning <entity id=4200>Sansa</entity> will be stuck with <entity id=4202>Joffrey</entity> again ) , but <entity id=4203>Olenna</entity> assures her that her son <entity id=4204>Mace</entity> is too intent on Margaery entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything . <entity id=4205>Shae</entity> sneaks into <entity id=4206>Tyrion Lannister</entity> 's new chambers . He warns her that his father threatened to kill her if he found her with him again , and that his father follows through on such threats . <entity id=4207>Undeterred</entity> , <entity id=4208>Shae</entity> starts undressing <entity id=4209>Tyrion</entity> , and asks him for a favor ; to protect <entity id=4210>Sansa</entity> from <entity id=4211>Baelish</entity> . <entity id=4212>Tyrion</entity> says that he no longer has enough power or influence to attempt to do that , though <entity id=4213>Shae</entity> accuses him of being attracted to <entity id=4214>Sansa</entity> , which he cheerfully denies . It also comes out that <entity id=4215>Tyrion</entity> had sex with <entity id=4216>Ros</entity> back in the <entity id=4217>North</entity> , though <entity id=4215>Tyrion</entity> points out it was before he met <entity id=4218>Shae</entity> . They playfully bicker about it as they start having sex . <entity id=4219>Margaery</entity> finds a way to bond with <entity id=4220>Joffrey</entity> . <entity id=4221>Margaery</entity> is summoned to <entity id=4222>Joffrey</entity> 's chambers to see if she needs anything before he leaves on a hunting trip . While <entity id=4223>Joffrey</entity> has previously been easy for <entity id=4224>Margaery</entity> to manipulate , <entity id=4225>Cersei</entity> was apparently able to plant one seed of doubt in his mind ; the fact that <entity id=4224>Margaery</entity> was married to his uncle <entity id=4226>Renly</entity> ( and thus , already had sex with another man ) , whom <entity id=4225>Cersei</entity> described as a `` traitor and known degenerate '' . When questioned , <entity id=4227>Margaery</entity> says that she was ordered to marry a traitor as her family duty , but <entity id=4228>Joffrey</entity> implies that this still means he must have had sex with her . <entity id=4229>Joffrey</entity> angrily questions Margaery about the relationship and she delicately placates him by feigning demure shyness and painting herself as a dutiful , but frustrated , bride . She uses the rumors about <entity id=4230>Renly</entity> 's homosexuality to redirect <entity id=4231>Joffrey</entity> 's anger , stating that <entity id=4230>Renly</entity> always found excuses to avoid sex , but , in one instance , drunkenly suggested `` something that sounded very painful and could not possibly result in children '' , which draws her new fiance 's sympathy . <entity id=4232>Margaery</entity> eventually manages to divert attention to the new custom crossbow <entity id=4233>Joffrey</entity> 's had made for his excursion . It quickly becomes apparent that <entity id=4234>Joffrey</entity> is excited by violence and sadism , so she flirts with him by complimenting the crossbow and musing about killing something herself . Easily played , <entity id=4235>Joffrey</entity> offers to take her with him to share in the excitement of killing something . King <entity id=4236>Robb Stark</entity> settles into the council chamber at <entity id=4237>Harrenhal</entity> with his wife <entity id=4238>Queen Talisa</entity> . <entity id=4239>Lord Lord</entity> interrupts them with two messenger-raven missives , each of which brings bad news . First , <entity id=4240>Robb</entity> 's maternal grandfather <entity id=4241>Hoster Tully</entity> has finally died after a long illness at his castle of <entity id=4242>Riverrun</entity> . <entity id=4243>Second</entity> , <entity id=4244>Roose</entity> delivers a letter from his bastard son <entity id=4245>Ramsay Snow</entity> , stating that the ironborn torched <entity id=4246>Winterfell</entity> and put all of its inhabitants to the sword , and then fled all before his force arrived there . There has been no sighting of <entity id=4247>Bran</entity> or <entity id=4248>Rickon</entity> , and though <entity id=4249>Robb</entity> hopes that they are still alive , there is a strong possibility that they are dead . Moreover , there has been no word of <entity id=4250>Theon</entity> , and if he took the boys captive the <entity id=4251>Greyjoys</entity> have n't sent out any demands . This double-blow reduces <entity id=4252>Catelyn Stark</entity> to tears and she laments that she had not seen her father in years . She is horrified at the thought that <entity id=4253>Bran</entity> and <entity id=4254>Rickon</entity> were in danger while she was away and could not protect them , and are now likely dead . <entity id=4255>Robb</entity> leaves <entity id=4256>Roose</entity> in command of <entity id=4257>Harrenhal</entity> with a detachment of the <entity id=4258>Northern</entity> army while <entity id=4255>Robb</entity> leads his main host back across the <entity id=4259>Riverlands</entity> to <entity id=4260>Riverrun</entity> . <entity id=4261>Lord Lord</entity> angrily says that this is a waste of time , though <entity id=4262>Robb</entity> points out that <entity id=4263>Catelyn</entity> 's brother and his uncle , <entity id=4264>Edmure Tully</entity> , is now lord of <entity id=4265>Riverrun</entity> and his levies will reinforce their army . <entity id=4266>Karstark</entity> maintains that unless <entity id=4267>Edmure</entity> has been breeding soldiers like rabbits , it will make no difference : with their new <entity id=4268>Tyrell</entity> allies , the Lannisters now outnumber them over two to one . <entity id=4269>Robb</entity> asks if <entity id=4270>Karstark</entity> has lost faith in their cause , and <entity id=4270>Karstark</entity> says he still believes in revenge . However , the fact that <entity id=4271>Robb</entity> lost his home castle makes him seem vulnerable in the eyes of his bannermen , and many no longer believe in <entity id=4271>Robb</entity> as they once did . <entity id=4272>Lord Lord</entity> asks to speak his mind ( as if he was n't already ) , and says that he thinks <entity id=4273>Robb</entity> lost the war the day he married <entity id=4274>Talisa</entity> , a political nobody , throwing away any opportunity to forge marriage-alliances with badly needed allies , specifically breaking his promise to enter into a marriage-alliance with <entity id=4275>House Frey</entity> . <entity id=4276>Talisa</entity> notices that <entity id=4277>Catelyn</entity> is making a prayer wheel for the <entity id=4278>Faith</entity> of the Seven , and offers to help . <entity id=4279>Catelyn</entity> explains that they can only be made by mothers who are praying for the welfare of their children . <entity id=4280>Catelyn</entity> reveals that she has only made them twice before , one of which was when she was praying for <entity id=4281>Bran</entity> to wake from his coma , which worked after a fashion , as he did survive though he lost the use of his legs . <entity id=4282>Talisa</entity> asks after the other time , and <entity id=4283>Catelyn</entity> says that when they were younger , one of the boys had a pox , and <entity id=4284>Maester Luwin</entity> said that if he survived the night he would be all right , but that it would be a long night . <entity id=4285>Catelyn</entity> explains that the boy was <entity id=4286>Jon Snow</entity> , and at first the thought that <entity id=4287>Jon</entity> would conveniently die of natural causes made her inwardly pray to the Seven for his end . However , <entity id=4288>Catelyn</entity> then became horrified at herself for thinking such a thing , particularly as <entity id=4289>Jon</entity> was an innocent child , and the person <entity id=4288>Catelyn</entity> really hated was <entity id=4289>Jon</entity> 's unidentified mother . So she made a prayer wheel and stayed up with him all night , praying to the gods that if they forgave her earlier wish that <entity id=4290>Jon</entity> would die , she promised she would urge <entity id=4291>Eddard</entity> to have <entity id=4290>Jon</entity> legitimized as a Stark and she would raise him as her own son . <entity id=4292>Jon</entity> recovered , however , <entity id=4293>Catelyn</entity> did not keep her promise . In grief at the death of her father and apparent death of her two youngest sons , and her continued grief at losing <entity id=4294>Eddard</entity> , <entity id=4295>Catelyn</entity> says the gods are punishing her misconduct with this war . Not too far away in the <entity id=4296>Riverlands</entity> , <entity id=4297>Arya Stark</entity> , <entity id=4298>Gendry</entity> , and <entity id=4299>Hot Pie</entity> are heading north from <entity id=4300>Harrenhal</entity> , planning to eventually reach the <entity id=4301>Red Fork</entity> of the <entity id=4302>Trident River</entity> and then follow it west to her grandfather 's castle-seat at <entity id=4303>Riverrun</entity> . Off-screen , <entity id=4304>Arya</entity> explained to the boys how <entity id=4305>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> helped them escape because he offered that he would kill any three people she named . <entity id=4306>Gendry</entity> loudly criticizes <entity id=4307>Arya</entity> , in disbelief that she used up two of the names on minor Lannister guards when she could have said someone like `` King Joffrey '' or `` <entity id=4308>Tywin Lannister</entity> '' and ended the entire war , at which <entity id=4307>Arya</entity> gets quite defensive . However , as they advance in the forest , they run into a scouting party of the <entity id=4309>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> , a group of outlaws , whose leader <entity id=4310>Thoros</entity> of Myr they hear singing `` The <entity id=4311>Rains</entity> of Castamere '' as they approach . They recognize them as the group the <entity id=4312>Lannister</entity> torturers were asking about at <entity id=4313>Harrenhal</entity> . <entity id=4314>Thoros</entity> seems a friendly sort , and they make the children come with them . They later give them food and drink at a local inn . <entity id=4315>Gendry</entity> says he used to work as a smith in <entity id=4316>King</entity> 's Landing for <entity id=4317>Tobho Mott</entity> , whom <entity id=4318>Thoros</entity> recognizes but says he charged double what the other smiths did ; <entity id=4315>Gendry</entity> counters that 's because it was double the quality . <entity id=4319>Arya</entity> insists that she knows how to use a sword despite <entity id=4320>Thoros</entity> ' disbelief , but when she tries to mock-fence with him he quickly disarms her . Other members of the <entity id=4321>Brotherhood</entity> return to the inn with a captive ; <entity id=4322>Sandor</entity> `` The <entity id=4323>Hound</entity> '' <entity id=4324>Clegane</entity> . As <entity id=4325>Thoros</entity> trades insults with <entity id=4326>Sandor</entity> , <entity id=4327>Arya</entity> tries to leave , but the <entity id=4328>Hound</entity> stops her in astonishment and asks what in seven hells they 're doing with `` the <entity id=4329>Stark</entity> bitch '' , revealing her identity to all . Finally , <entity id=4330>Jaime Lannister</entity> and <entity id=4331>Brienne</entity> of <entity id=4332>Tarth</entity> are slowly making their way across country through the <entity id=4333>Riverlands</entity> , heading to <entity id=4334>King</entity> 's Landing intending to make the prisoner exchange for the Stark girls ( really , just <entity id=4335>Sansa</entity> ) . Jaime continues to mock <entity id=4336>Brienne</entity> along the way . <entity id=4337>Brienne</entity> is wary enough not to let Jaime out of her sight , even insisting on keeping him on his leash and watching while he urinates so he does n't slip away . <entity id=4338>Jaime</entity> deduces that <entity id=4339>Brienne</entity> is n't from the <entity id=4340>North</entity> because he would have noticed her at <entity id=4341>Winterfell</entity> when he visited there , so ( as she is from <entity id=4342>House Tarth</entity> ) she must be a <entity id=4343>Baratheon</entity> supporter . She angrily denies supporting <entity id=4344>Stannis</entity> , thus confirming that she served Renly . Jaime accurately deduces that she fancied Renly , but points out that <entity id=4345>Renly</entity> was n't attracted to women so much as he was to <entity id=4346>Loras</entity> . <entity id=4347>Brienne</entity> says she does n't want to hear his filthy lies , but he says that he knew Renly better than she did , reminding her that both of them spent the last 17 years living in the <entity id=4348>Red Keep</entity> , ever since <entity id=4349>Robert</entity> 's Rebellion when <entity id=4350>Renly</entity> was just a child prancing down the halls . Jaime insists that <entity id=4351>Renly</entity> 's homosexuality was actually `` the worst kept secret at court '' if she thinks he 's lying . He continues to casually mock Renly which makes <entity id=4352>Brienne</entity> grab him , but he relents and says he does n't particularly care that Renly loved <entity id=4353>Loras</entity> , as he feels people are n't free to choose the ones they love ( which he knows better than most ) . They come across a farmer with a heavily laden mule , who notices that they 're cutting cross-country and avoiding the major roads , and suspects that they 're avoiding soldiers . <entity id=4354>Jaime</entity> tells <entity id=4355>Brienne</entity> that he suspects the man is a scout meant to intercept them , and even if he is n't he can still spread word he saw them . He urges her to kill the man , but she refuses . <entity id=4356>Brienne</entity> gives Jaime a beatdown . Later , the pair have to cross a river , which means they can either attempt a dangerous fording or take the bridge , which will probably be watched . <entity id=4357>Brienne</entity> takes the safer route of the bridge , but <entity id=4358>Jaime</entity> manages to distract her long enough to take away her spare sword and cut his bonds . <entity id=4359>Brienne</entity> and <entity id=4360>Jaime</entity> enter into an extended sword fight on the bridge . <entity id=4361>Jaime</entity> starts off very aggressively , putting <entity id=4362>Brienne</entity> on the defensive . However , <entity id=4363>Jaime</entity> 's mobility is reduced because his hands are still manacled , and he is malnourished after having spent the past full year chained up in a cell . Jaime begins to tire , and <entity id=4364>Brienne</entity> wears him down further by making body-blows with kicks and punches . After a protracted fight Jaime finally slumps to the ground in exhaustion . Just then , riders from <entity id=4365>House Bolton</entity> arrive led by a man named <entity id=4366>Locke</entity> . <entity id=4367>Jaime</entity> asks if they want to negotiate , but <entity id=4368>Locke</entity> says they 'll have his head if he does n't bring the <entity id=4369>Kingslayer</entity> back to the King in the <entity id=4370>North</entity> , so there 's not much Jaime can do to dissuade him from taking them prisoner .
