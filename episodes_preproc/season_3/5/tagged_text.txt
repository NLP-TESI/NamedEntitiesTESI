The <entity id=5231>Hound</entity> is judged by the gods ; Jaime is judged ; <entity id=5232>Jon</entity> proves himself ; <entity id=5233>Robb</entity> is betrayed ; <entity id=5234>Tyrion</entity> learns the cost of weddings . Beyond the <entity id=5235>Wall</entity> . <entity id=5236>Tormund</entity> warns <entity id=5237>Jon</entity> . <entity id=5238>Jon Jon</entity> is with the group of twenty wildlings under the command of <entity id=5239>Tormund</entity> , who were sent ahead of the main army of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder to scale the <entity id=5240>Wall</entity> and attack <entity id=5241>Castle Black</entity> from behind . <entity id=5242>Jon</entity> and <entity id=5243>Ygritte</entity> are gathering firewood , when the warg <entity id=5244>Orell</entity> asks him about the defenses of the <entity id=5245>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity id=5246>Orell</entity> has seen through the eyes of his eagle that there are patrols on top of the <entity id=5247>Wall</entity> and he wants to know how frequent they are . <entity id=5248>Jon</entity> says they usually sent out patrols in teams of four , two builders to inspect for structural damage and two rangers to protect them , but that the frequency of their patrols often changes . <entity id=5249>Orell</entity> says the wildlings know there are nineteen castles along the south side of the <entity id=5250>Wall</entity> , but he wants to know how many are currently manned . <entity id=5251>Jon</entity> finds this very unpleasant , but reluctantly says that only three are currently manned . Apart from <entity id=5252>Castle Black</entity> ( which even the wildlings know is manned ) , there is also Eastwatch-by-the-Sea at the extreme eastern end , and The <entity id=5253>Shadow Tower</entity> at the western end . <entity id=5254>Jon</entity> is then asked how many men currently garrison <entity id=5255>Castle Black</entity> . <entity id=5256>Jon</entity> is very reluctant to answer , but after being threatened by <entity id=5257>Orell</entity> , he gives an exaggerated number , saying there are one thousand men ( this is a lie , as <entity id=5258>Castle Black</entity> only had six hundred men before the <entity id=5259>Great Ranging</entity> , and the garrison now is closer to three hundred ) . <entity id=5260>Tormund</entity> tells <entity id=5261>Jon</entity> that he likes him , but if he 's lying to them , he 'll rip his guts out through his throat . <entity id=5262>Ygritte</entity> is caught off-guard when <entity id=5263>Jon</entity> begins performing oral sex on her . <entity id=5264>Jon</entity> and <entity id=5265>Ygritte</entity> then walk away , but she steals his sword <entity id=5266>Longclaw</entity> , making him chase her to get it back . She leads him into a nearby cave , which is heated by natural hotsprings , which form a waterfall and a pool . <entity id=5267>Ygritte</entity> starts disrobing , and says that she wants to make sure <entity id=5268>Jon Snow</entity> has truly come over to the wildlings ' side and broken his <entity id=5269>Night's Watch</entity> vows - by making him break his oath of celibacy with her . She quickly shucks off all of her clothes and walks up to him naked . <entity id=5270>Jon</entity> is very hesitant to break his vows , and very shy because he 's never had sex before . <entity id=5271>Ygritte</entity> questions why he 's still dressed , and they start kissing . <entity id=5272>Jon</entity> continues to kiss down her body as she insists that he has no experience and therefore `` You know nothing , <entity id=5273>Jon Sn</entity> -- '' but stops mid-word as <entity id=5272>Jon</entity> starts performing oral sex on her . <entity id=5274>Jon</entity> and <entity id=5275>Ygritte</entity> taking a bath after sex . Some time after they finish having sex , they lie together in a naked embrace . <entity id=5276>Ygritte</entity> asks if `` that thing you did with your mouth '' is what Lords do to their Ladies in the south , but <entity id=5277>Jon</entity> says she just seemed to like it when he kissed her there . He admits he 's never had sex with anyone before and is `` a maid '' , though <entity id=5278>Ygritte</entity> starts listing off some wildling boys she 's had sex with before . The first was a boy who also had red hair like her , which is rare among the wildlings and considered very lucky : they call having red hair being `` kissed by fire '' , and another was a Thenn that was `` built like an ox '' , but he could not speak the <entity id=5279>Common Tongue</entity> . <entity id=5280>Jon</entity> and <entity id=5281>Ygritte</entity> then slide into the hot springs pool to take a bath together and romantically cuddle more . <entity id=5282>Ygritte</entity> tells <entity id=5283>Jon</entity> she wishes they could stay in this cave forever ( instead of having to leave and face the winter , wars , and monsters outside ) . Across the <entity id=5284>Narrow Sea</entity> . In <entity id=5285>Slaver</entity> 's <entity id=5286>Bay</entity> , <entity id=5287>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> 's new army of freed <entity id=5288>Unsullied</entity> , having just sacked <entity id=5289>Astapor</entity> , head north to the next of the three great slaver-cities , <entity id=5290>Yunkai</entity> . <entity id=5291>Ser Ser</entity> tells <entity id=5292>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> how he was knighted at the end of the <entity id=5293>Greyjoy Rebellion</entity> , in which they both fought . <entity id=5294>Jorah</entity> explains that he was the second man through the breach during the <entity id=5295>Siege</entity> of <entity id=5296>Pyke</entity> , right behind <entity id=5297>Thoros</entity> of <entity id=5298>Myr</entity> , who charged in headlong waving about his flaming sword . <entity id=5299>Barristan</entity> thinks this is amusing as he was n't there ( he was commanding the <entity id=5300>Siege</entity> of <entity id=5301>Old Wyk</entity> at the time ) . King <entity id=5302>Robert Baratheon</entity> himself knighted <entity id=5303>Jorah</entity> for his bravery that day , the proudest of <entity id=5303>Jorah</entity> 's life , though he says what he was most thinking about was that he really needed to piss because he 'd been sealed in metal plate armor for sixteen hours straight . <entity id=5304>Barristan</entity> admits that <entity id=5305>Robert</entity> was a good man and a good warrior , but laments that he turned out to be a terrible king . <entity id=5306>Barristan</entity> laments that he wasted so much of his life defending kings who did n't deserve it ; seventeen years defending <entity id=5307>Robert</entity> , and the <entity id=5308>Mad King K N</entity> before that . <entity id=5309>Barristan</entity> explains that a man of honor must keep his vows no matter what , whether he 's serving a drunk or a lunatic ( the reason why he never turned on King Aerys the way <entity id=5310>Jaime Lannister</entity> ultimately did ) . <entity id=5311>Barristan</entity> says that just once before he dies , he wants to know what it 's like to serve with pride , fighting for someone he believes in . Their talk turns to <entity id=5312>Daenerys</entity> , and <entity id=5313>Jorah</entity> says that <entity id=5314>Barristan</entity> can believe in her . <entity id=5315>Barristan</entity> says she 'll have good men to advise her , though he respectfully warns that it might not be well for her to be seen with <entity id=5316>Jorah</entity> at her side when they return to <entity id=5317>Westeros</entity> ; <entity id=5316>Jorah</entity> admits that he may never be rid of the moral taint of selling slaves , which is abhorred in <entity id=5317>Westeros</entity> . <entity id=5318>Jorah</entity> then begins to subtly ask about the advisors on the <entity id=5319>Small Council</entity> , if any of them spoke against <entity id=5320>Robert</entity> when he wanted <entity id=5321>Daenerys</entity> , the last Targaryen , assassinated . It becomes apparent that <entity id=5322>Jorah</entity> is trying to figure out if <entity id=5323>Barristan</entity> knew that <entity id=5322>Jorah</entity> was initially a spy for King <entity id=5324>Robert</entity> , reporting back to <entity id=5325>Varys</entity> . <entity id=5326>Jorah</entity> 's report that <entity id=5327>Daenerys</entity> was pregnant is what made <entity id=5328>Robert</entity> demand that <entity id=5327>Daenerys</entity> be assassinated at a <entity id=5329>Small Council</entity> meeting with <entity id=5330>Ned Stark</entity> . <entity id=5331>Jorah</entity> points out that the <entity id=5332>Lord Commander</entity> of the <entity id=5333>Kingsguard</entity> traditionally holds a seat on the <entity id=5334>Small Council</entity> . However , <entity id=5335>Barristan</entity> explains that as a former <entity id=5336>Kingsguard</entity> member under <entity id=5337>Aerys Targaryen</entity> , and one who 'd killed several of <entity id=5338>Robert</entity> 's friends , while <entity id=5338>Robert</entity> did n't mind keeping him in his position as a guard , he never really trusted his advice , so he left him out of <entity id=5339>Small Council</entity> meetings . <entity id=5340>Jorah</entity> is relieved that <entity id=5341>Barristan</entity> was therefore not present at any council meeting so he could n't have learned that <entity id=5340>Jorah</entity> was sending it reports on <entity id=5342>Daenerys</entity> . <entity id=5343>Jorah</entity> and <entity id=5344>Barristan</entity> briefly bicker about the fact that <entity id=5344>Barristan</entity> only just came to them , while <entity id=5343>Jorah</entity> was defending <entity id=5345>Daenerys</entity> from <entity id=5346>Robert Baratheon</entity> 's assassins for months , and <entity id=5344>Barristan</entity> is n't <entity id=5347>Lord Commander</entity> here ; <entity id=5343>Jorah</entity> takes his orders from <entity id=5345>Daenerys</entity> . Meanwhile , <entity id=5348>Daenerys</entity> and her translator/aide-de-camp Missandei meet with the assembled officers of the <entity id=5349>Unsullied</entity> . She addresses them in <entity id=5350>Low Valyrian</entity> , and says that now that they are no longer slaves but free men and they can make their own choices , and she asked them to choose one among them to be leader of all the <entity id=5351>Unsullied</entity> . They part ranks and one of the eunuchs steps forward . She asks him to remove his helmet and tell her his name , and he introduces himself as `` <entity id=5352>Grey Worm</entity> '' . <entity id=5353>Daenerys</entity> is confused , and <entity id=5354>Missandei</entity> explains that when the slavemasters of <entity id=5355>Astapor</entity> castrate slave-boys to train them as Unsullied , they force new slave-names onto them which are intentionally demeaning , usually a combination of a color and a kind of vermin , i.e . `` <entity id=5356>Grey Worm</entity> '' , `` Red Flea '' , `` <entity id=5357>Black Rat</entity> '' , etc . This is to enforce the mentality in the Unsullied that this is just what they are : worthless , expendable vermin . Disgusted , <entity id=5358>Daenerys</entity> issues the command that all Unsullied must choose their own new names as free men , or reclaim the names their parents gave them . The <entity id=5359>Unsullied</entity> commander says that he will continue to be known as `` <entity id=5360>Grey Worm</entity> '' : his original name is accursed , because it was the name he had when he was taken as a slave , but `` <entity id=5360>Grey Worm</entity> '' is a lucky name he will bear with pride , because it is the name he had when he was set free by <entity id=5361>Daenerys Stormborn</entity> of <entity id=5362>House Targaryen</entity> . <entity id=5363>Daenerys</entity> is deeply touched by his loyalty . In the <entity id=5364>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . At <entity id=5365>Riverrun</entity> , the prisoners <entity id=5366>Martyn</entity> and <entity id=5367>Willem Lannister</entity> ( squires fifteen and fourteen years old , respectively ) awake to hear shouting and fighting outside the door to their cell . <entity id=5368>Lord Lord</entity> fights his way into the room with some of his own men . Confused , <entity id=5369>Willem</entity> asks if this is a rescue , and is promptly killed by the <entity id=5370>Karstark</entity> men . <entity id=5371>Martyn</entity> begs that he is just a squire and did n't do anything , but <entity id=5372>Lord Rickard</entity> ignores his pleas and stabs him in the belly with a dagger , killing him . <entity id=5373>Martyn</entity> and <entity id=5374>Willem</entity> lie dead before <entity id=5375>Robb</entity> . The bloody corpses of the two Lannister prisoners are laid out on the floor in front of King in the <entity id=5376>North Robb Stark</entity> in <entity id=5377>Riverrun</entity> 's main meeting room . <entity id=5378>Robb</entity> is disgusted , remarking that <entity id=5379>Karstark</entity> needed five men to brutally murder two unarmed squires in their own prison cell . <entity id=5380>Karstark</entity> insists that it was a father 's vengeance . <entity id=5381>Robb</entity> points out that these boys had nothing to do with the death of <entity id=5382>Karstark</entity> 's sons , who were both killed by <entity id=5383>Jaime Lannister</entity> . <entity id=5384>Rickard</entity> explains that he was denied his vengeance when <entity id=5385>Robb</entity> 's mother <entity id=5386>Catelyn</entity> set <entity id=5387>Jaime</entity> free in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in <entity id=5388>King</entity> 's Landing . Finally having enough , <entity id=5389>Karstark</entity> did the next best thing , and killed <entity id=5390>Jaime</entity> 's kin who they held prisoner . <entity id=5391>Robb</entity> angrily shouts that they were only little boys , and <entity id=5392>Karstark</entity> ca n't blame <entity id=5393>Catelyn</entity> for his treasonous killing of prisoners of war . <entity id=5394>Karstark</entity> stands firm , and says the only treason is in letting their enemies go , when in war they should be killing them - if <entity id=5395>Robb</entity> 's father ever taught him that . <entity id=5396>Brynden Brynden</entity> punches <entity id=5397>Karstark</entity> over this remark , but <entity id=5398>Robb</entity> tells him to leave <entity id=5397>Karstark</entity> alone . <entity id=5399>Karstark</entity> has utterly lost faith in <entity id=5400>Robb</entity> , and says that the King in the <entity id=5401>North</entity> will just give him a scolding , though he should probably call him `` the King Who Lost the <entity id=5401>North</entity> '' after he allowed <entity id=5402>Winterfell</entity> to fall . <entity id=5403>Robb</entity> orders all of <entity id=5404>Karstark</entity> 's men hanged , and to hang the lookout last so he can watch the others die . <entity id=5405>Rickard Rickard</entity> himself is sent to the dungeons . <entity id=5406>Robb</entity> 's uncle <entity id=5407>Edmure Tully</entity> insists that if word of this leaves <entity id=5408>Riverrun</entity> , <entity id=5409>Tywin Lannister</entity> will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews . Therefore , he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys , and simply keep silent about their deaths until the war is over . <entity id=5410>Robb</entity> , however , refuses to be a liar : he says he can not fight a war in the name of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks . All of <entity id=5411>Robb</entity> 's advisors tell him this is a bad idea . <entity id=5412>Catelyn</entity> and his wife <entity id=5413>Talisa</entity> warn him that the <entity id=5414>Karstark</entity> soldiers will abandon his cause and return home if he executes their lord , and they are already badly outnumbered . <entity id=5415>Catelyn</entity> says they should keep <entity id=5416>Lord Rickard</entity> hostage , and <entity id=5417>Edmure</entity> agrees , saying that they can just keep him hostage and tell the other Karstarks that no harm will come to him so long as they remain loyal . <entity id=5418>Robb</entity> executes <entity id=5419>Rickard</entity> . <entity id=5420>Robb</entity> ignores their pleas , and he has <entity id=5421>Lord Karstark</entity> brought out to the courtyard of <entity id=5422>Riverrun</entity> to be executed during a driving rainstorm . <entity id=5423>Karstark</entity> points out that not only are both of their Houses descended from the <entity id=5424>First Men</entity> , but the <entity id=5425>Starks</entity> and <entity id=5426>Karstarks</entity> are kin ( as <entity id=5427>House Karstark</entity> is a cadet branch of <entity id=5428>House Stark</entity> , founded centuries ago by younger son <entity id=5429>Karlon Stark</entity> ) . <entity id=5430>Robb</entity> says that their blood relationship did not stop <entity id=5431>Rickard</entity> from betraying him and wo n't stop <entity id=5430>Robb</entity> from executing him now , but <entity id=5431>Rickard</entity> says it is n't meant to : he wants it to haunt <entity id=5430>Robb</entity> until the day he dies . With his last words , <entity id=5432>Lord Rickard</entity> says that <entity id=5433>Robb</entity> will be cursed ( as a kinslayer ) and that <entity id=5433>Robb</entity> is no king of his . <entity id=5434>Obedient</entity> to the laws of his father <entity id=5435>Eddard Stark</entity> - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - <entity id=5436>Robb</entity> pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads <entity id=5437>Lord Rickard</entity> . <entity id=5438>Robb</entity> 's strict adherence to justice makes things turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would : the <entity id=5439>Karstarks</entity> withdraw their soldiers from his army and march for home , resulting in <entity id=5438>Robb</entity> losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at <entity id=5440>Riverrun</entity> . <entity id=5441>Robb</entity> openly admits to Talisa that she was right , and he made a mistake . <entity id=5442>Robb</entity> says <entity id=5443>Tywin Lannister</entity> realizes that he 's in such a strong position he does n't even need to attack the <entity id=5444>Northerners</entity> anymore , he just needs to wait , and let their demoralized forces unravel . When the war began <entity id=5445>Robb</entity> 's army was unified around a central purpose , but now they have lost momentum , and his generals are acting like bickering children . <entity id=5446>Robb</entity> shows <entity id=5447>Talisa</entity> a war map of the <entity id=5448>Seven Kingdoms</entity> - depicting <entity id=5446>Robb</entity> 's armies concentrated around <entity id=5449>Riverrun</entity> and <entity id=5450>Harrenhal</entity> , <entity id=5451>Lannister</entity> and <entity id=5452>Tyrell</entity> armies overrunning the <entity id=5453>Stormlands</entity> , Lannister/Tyrell armies concentrated in <entity id=5454>King</entity> 's Landing , and <entity id=5455>Greyjoy</entity> forces occupying the western coasts of the <entity id=5456>North</entity> . <entity id=5457>Talisa</entity> suggests that he try to take the fight to the <entity id=5458>Lannisters</entity> if they wo n't come to him , but he explains that this is hopeless . Taking <entity id=5459>King</entity> 's Landing would have been difficult to begin with , but now <entity id=5460>Tywin</entity> and the bulk of the main Lannister army , as well as a large <entity id=5461>Tyrell</entity> army , are defending the city . Attacking the capital head-on would be suicide , and <entity id=5462>Tywin</entity> would crush them within a day . <entity id=5463>Talisa</entity> suggests that he lead his army back to the <entity id=5464>North</entity> to repulse the <entity id=5465>Greyjoys</entity> from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase . <entity id=5466>Robb</entity> points out that as soon as all of his tired soldiers are back home , they wo n't want to leave again - particularly because `` winter is coming , '' and the coming one is expected to be very long , five years or more . The Northerners have been away from their farms fighting in the war , however , so they have n't even begun to collect harvests to set aside as winter stockpiles . Thus if <entity id=5467>Robb</entity> returns to the <entity id=5468>North</entity> , it will be difficult to rally his men to return south to defend the Riverlords who declared for him . Eyeing the map with <entity id=5469>Talisa</entity> , <entity id=5470>Robb</entity> decides that if <entity id=5471>King</entity> 's Landing is too strong to attack and he ca n't return home , his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest . <entity id=5472>Robb</entity> decides that with the main Lannister army-group under <entity id=5473>Tywin</entity> now positioned all the way to the east in <entity id=5474>King</entity> 's Landing , he needs to return to the <entity id=5475>Westerlands</entity> and make an all-or-nothing assault against <entity id=5476>Casterly Rock</entity> . This will make the <entity id=5477>Lannisters</entity> lose face , just as <entity id=5478>Robb</entity> did when he lost his home castle of <entity id=5479>Winterfell</entity> , and bring momentum back to his army . However , with the loss of the <entity id=5480>Karstark</entity> forces , they do n't currently have enough men to consider attacking <entity id=5481>Casterly Rock</entity> . The only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if <entity id=5482>Robb</entity> can win back the allegiance of <entity id=5483>House Frey</entity> , whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from <entity id=5482>Robb</entity> 's army when he broke his promise to make a marriage-alliance with them by marrying <entity id=5484>Talisa</entity> , a political nobody , instead of one of the <entity id=5485>Lord Walder Frey</entity> 's daughters . Thus , <entity id=5486>Robb</entity> must try to repair his alliance with <entity id=5487>House Frey</entity> . <entity id=5488>Locke</entity> taunting <entity id=5489>Jaime</entity> about his hand . At <entity id=5490>Harrenhal</entity> , <entity id=5491>Locke</entity> presents the captive Jaime Lannister and <entity id=5492>Brienne</entity> of <entity id=5493>Tarth</entity> to the <entity id=5494>Northern</entity> castellan , <entity id=5495>Lord Roose Bolton</entity> . <entity id=5496>Locke</entity> is quite proud of himself for his torture of <entity id=5497>Jaime</entity> , but <entity id=5498>Roose</entity> is surprised that <entity id=5497>Jaime</entity> has lost his hand . <entity id=5499>Oblivious</entity> , <entity id=5500>Locke</entity> boasts that <entity id=5501>Jaime</entity> has n't `` lost '' the hand , and points out that he cut it off and hung <entity id=5501>Jaime</entity> 's own hand around his neck . <entity id=5502>Angered</entity> that <entity id=5503>Locke</entity> maimed such a valuable hostage , <entity id=5504>Bolton</entity> demands that he dispose of <entity id=5505>Jaime</entity> 's rotting hand , and orders that accommodations be provided for the pair of prisoners . When <entity id=5506>Jaime</entity> asks if there is news from the capital , <entity id=5507>Bolton</entity> informs him that <entity id=5508>Stannis Baratheon</entity> laid siege to the city in the <entity id=5509>Battle</entity> of the <entity id=5510>Blackwater</entity> . then needlessly drags out revealing the result . <entity id=5511>Bolton</entity> toys with Jaime but remains completely calm , never even grinning , before finally revealing that his sister <entity id=5512>Cersei</entity> is alive and well , and his father 's forces successfully repulsed <entity id=5513>Stannis</entity> 's assault . <entity id=5514>Jaime</entity> is so overcome by delirium and relief that his family is safe that he collapses . <entity id=5515>Bolton</entity> calls for <entity id=5516>Qyburn</entity> to attend to <entity id=5517>Jaime</entity> 's injuries . Later , <entity id=5518>Qyburn</entity> peels away the crude tourniquet that <entity id=5519>Locke</entity> 's men applied to <entity id=5520>Jaime</entity> , and finds that the stump of his right arm has become badly infected . <entity id=5521>Jaime</entity> asks if he will die , and <entity id=5522>Qyburn</entity> says he wo n't , but the corruption has spread to the point that it would be safest just to amputate the rest of his right arm at the shoulder . Half-delirious from the infection , <entity id=5523>Jaime</entity> refuses , and says he 'll kill <entity id=5524>Qyburn</entity> if he tries . Jaime then notices that <entity id=5525>Qyburn</entity> is not a Maester , because he is n't wearing a maester 's chain of office . <entity id=5526>Qyburn</entity> acknowledges this , explaining that he was stripped of his chain by the <entity id=5527>Citadel</entity> and thrown out of the Order of <entity id=5528>Maesters</entity> , because as he says , he was conducting experiments which they felt were `` too bold . '' <entity id=5529>Qyburn</entity> gets ready to cut <entity id=5530>Jaime</entity> , and says he 'll at least try to save his elbow , but with a sudden burst of effort <entity id=5530>Jaime</entity> grabs him around the throat with his left hand , and says he does n't need his right hand to kill him . <entity id=5531>Qyburn</entity> relents , and says he could try cutting out the chunks of flesh which are outright rotten , then burning out the wounds with boiling wine , and with luck this might be able to stop the infection without having to amputate more of <entity id=5532>Jaime</entity> 's arm above the wrist . <entity id=5533>Jaime</entity> says he 's willing to try this , but <entity id=5534>Qyburn</entity> cautions that it will cause a great amount of pain so he needs to give him Milk of the <entity id=5535>Poppy</entity> , but <entity id=5533>Jaime</entity> refuses to take it , and says he 'll just scream . <entity id=5536>Qyburn</entity> cautions him that it will cause a massive amount of pain , but <entity id=5537>Jaime</entity> says that he will just scream loudly . <entity id=5538>Qyburn</entity> begins to dig into the stump of <entity id=5539>Jaime</entity> 's arm to cut out the gangrenous tissue , and <entity id=5539>Jaime</entity> howls in agony . Some time later , <entity id=5540>Brienne</entity> is in <entity id=5541>Harrenhal</entity> 's bathhouse , scrubbing off weeks ' worth of caked on grime and filth from the trek through the <entity id=5542>Riverlands</entity> . Jaime then appears in the doorway assisted by a servant , barely able to stand due to the pain he is in . He asks the servant to help him take off his muddy rags and leave . Jaime then walks naked into the same communal bath that <entity id=5543>Brienne</entity> is in , on the far side . She is also naked and angrily points out that there are other baths , but he says he wants this one ; he 's afraid he 's going to pass out at any moment , and wants her to save him from drowning if he does , because he does n't want to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub . <entity id=5544>Brienne</entity> asks why she should care how he dies , but he points out that she swore a solemn vow to get him to <entity id=5545>King</entity> 's Landing in one piece - which ( indicating the stump of his hand ) has not been going so well . <entity id=5546>Jaime</entity> quips that it 's no wonder Renly died with <entity id=5547>Brienne</entity> guarding him , at which she defiantly stands up out of the bath , facing him fully nude , to show him she is n't afraid of him . Jaime gravely says that was `` unworthy '' and asks for forgiveness , <entity id=5548>Brienne</entity> angrily orders him not to mock her , but he insists he 's seriously apologizing . Exhausted , <entity id=5549>Jaime</entity> says he 's tired of fighting and just wants to have a truce ; <entity id=5550>Brienne</entity> says you need trust to have a truce , but he says he trusts her , so she sits back down . Jaime recounts Aerys 's madness . Jaime then notes that <entity id=5551>Brienne</entity> has the same look on her face that he 's seen on countless faces in the past seventeen years : people that despise him , call him `` kingslayer '' more than his own name , or `` oathbreaker '' and `` a man without honor . '' Jaime then goes on to recall the <entity id=5552>Mad King's</entity> obsession with wildfire , how <entity id=5553>Aerys</entity> enjoyed watching people being burned alive . <entity id=5554>Jaime</entity> recalls <entity id=5555>Aerys</entity> burned lords he did n't like , <entity id=5556>Hands</entity> who failed him , and anyone he thought was against him . Ultimately , half of <entity id=5557>Westeros</entity> rebelled against him , so <entity id=5558>Aerys</entity> had his pyromancers place caches of wildfire all over <entity id=5559>King</entity> 's Landing : under the <entity id=5560>Great Sept</entity> of <entity id=5561>Baelor</entity> , under the slums of <entity id=5562>Flea Bottom</entity> , under houses , stables , taverns , and even under the <entity id=5563>Red Keep</entity> itself . After Robert's victory at the Trident he marched on the capital city , but <entity id=5564>Jaime</entity> 's father <entity id=5565>Tywin</entity> arrived there first , leading the entire Lannister army , and promising to defend the city . Jaime warned Aerys that his father was never a man to choose the losing side , that this must be a trick and he should surrender the city while he still could , but the <entity id=5566>Mad King</entity> refused to listen . Nor did <entity id=5567>Aerys</entity> listen to Varys when he gave the same warning that <entity id=5568>Tywin</entity> could n't be trusted - but he did listen to <entity id=5569>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> , who convinced Aerys the <entity id=5570>Lannisters</entity> were there to help . Aerys opened the city gates , and the <entity id=5571>Lannisters</entity> proceeded to sack the city . Jaime again begged Aerys to surrender , but the <entity id=5572>Mad King</entity> ordered <entity id=5573>Jaime</entity> to bring him <entity id=5574>Tywin</entity> 's head , and his pyromancer to set the city ablaze , burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with wildfire . <entity id=5575>Jaime</entity> makes it plain to <entity id=5576>Brienne</entity> that was his breaking point and asks her what she would do if her precious Renly commanded her to kill her own father and then stand by and do nothing as he murdered thousands of innocent people ; she can only sit in shocked silence . <entity id=5577>Jaime</entity> goes on to say that he killed the pyromancer first , then drove his sword into <entity id=5578>Aerys</entity> 's back as the <entity id=5579>Mad King</entity> tried to run for his life . Shaken at the memory , <entity id=5580>Jaime</entity> speculates that King <entity id=5581>Aerys</entity> did n't believe he would die in the blaze ; in his lunacy , the <entity id=5582>Mad King</entity> believed he would be reborn as a dragon in the fire , granting him the power to burn his enemies to ashes . so <entity id=5583>Jaime</entity> finished <entity id=5584>Aerys</entity> off by slitting his throat in order to make sure he died , concluding that <entity id=5585>Eddard Stark</entity> found him at that point . Stunned , <entity id=5586>Brienne</entity> asks why <entity id=5587>Jaime</entity> did n't defend himself with this account before . Jaime angrily rants that the `` honorable '' <entity id=5588>Lord Stark</entity> would never have believed a word he said : <entity id=5589>Stark</entity> did n't want to hear <entity id=5590>Jaime</entity> 's side of the story when he 'd already judged him guilty . Jaime faints . <entity id=5591>Jaime</entity> goes on to rage , yelling what right <entity id=5592>Stark</entity> had to judge him , by what right the wolf dares to judge the lion . The strain of recounting his harrowing tale overcomes Jaime , however , and he begins to faint , nearly falling face-first into the water . <entity id=5593>Brienne</entity> catches him and calls for help for the <entity id=5594>Kingslayer</entity> , at which ( as he slips out of consciousness ) he whimpers to himself `` Jaime . My name is Jaime . `` . The <entity id=5595>Hound</entity> vs <entity id=5596>Beric</entity> . Elsewhere in the <entity id=5597>Riverlands</entity> , at the hideout of the <entity id=5598>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> in <entity id=5599>Hollow Hill</entity> , <entity id=5600>Sandor Clegane</entity> prepares to fight <entity id=5601>Beric Dondarrion</entity> in a trial by combat . As both men prepare , <entity id=5602>Thoros</entity> of <entity id=5603>Myr</entity> prays to the <entity id=5604>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5605>Light</entity> to judge <entity id=5606>Sandor</entity> for his crimes if he is guilty or give strength to his sword if he is innocent . Before the fight begins , <entity id=5607>Beric</entity> calls upon the <entity id=5608>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5609>Light</entity> to ignite his sword with flame , using only his blood . Due to the <entity id=5610>Sandor</entity> 's fear of fire , <entity id=5611>Beric</entity> initially has an advantage against the <entity id=5612>Hound</entity> . <entity id=5613>Beric</entity> even manages to set <entity id=5614>Sandor</entity> 's wooden shield on fire , which is strapped so tightly to <entity id=5614>Sandor</entity> 's arm that he can not remove it and is nearly burned himself . Eventually , however , <entity id=5615>Sandor</entity> 's raw physical strength and anger ( born of terror ) overpowers <entity id=5616>Beric</entity> , and with a single downward swipe , cuts right through his flaming sword , his armor , and deep into his shoulder , killing him . <entity id=5617>Thoros</entity> reviving <entity id=5618>Beric</entity> . As <entity id=5619>Beric</entity> falls to the ground , <entity id=5620>Thoros</entity> quickly rushes to his side , and begins praying to the <entity id=5621>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5622>Light</entity> to revive him . <entity id=5623>Sandor</entity> falls to the ground to desperately try and extinguish his flaming shield . <entity id=5624>Arya Arya</entity> grabs a dagger and attempts to kill the <entity id=5625>Hound</entity> while he is down , but she is stopped by <entity id=5626>Gendry</entity> . As she curses him , <entity id=5627>Sandor</entity> taunts <entity id=5628>Arya</entity> over how the god prefers him over her dead friend , however they are both interrupted by <entity id=5629>Beric</entity> , who has been revived by the <entity id=5630>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5631>Light</entity> 's power . Having won the trial , and proven his innocence in the eyes of god , <entity id=5632>Sandor</entity> is allowed to leave . The <entity id=5633>Brotherhood</entity> had taken all of the gold <entity id=5634>Sandor</entity> had on him ( to fund their cause ) , and in lieu of returning it , <entity id=5635>Beric</entity> gives him a promissory note which will grant payment at the end of the war . <entity id=5636>Sandor</entity> scoffs at this and throws it to the ground , but <entity id=5637>Anguy</entity> says he should be thankful they 're letting him leave with his life . <entity id=5638>Clegane</entity> is hooded so he wo n't know the way back to their hideout , then led away to be released some distance away . After the fight , <entity id=5639>Gendry</entity> works on repairing <entity id=5640>Beric</entity> 's armor , and <entity id=5641>Arya</entity> questions why , because they will be leaving soon . <entity id=5642>Gendry</entity> says that he has decided to stay and work as a smith for the <entity id=5643>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> , to aid them in their cause to protect the smallfolk during the war . <entity id=5644>Arya</entity> says that their plan was to find her brother <entity id=5645>Robb</entity> , and <entity id=5645>Robb</entity> needs soldiers too , but <entity id=5646>Gendry</entity> points out that he has no attachments to <entity id=5647>Robb Stark</entity> : <entity id=5644>Arya</entity> would be going to her noble-born family , and he 'd just be serving another lord . <entity id=5648>Gendry</entity> says he 's been serving other men his whole life and he has nothing to show for it : he worked most of his life for <entity id=5649>Tobho Mott</entity> and he repaid Gendry by selling him to the <entity id=5650>Night's Watch</entity> ( as soon as the secret payments from <entity id=5651>Varys</entity> ended ) , and he `` served '' <entity id=5652>Tywin Lannister</entity> as a prisoner at <entity id=5653>Harrenhal</entity> , every day afraid he 'd be killed or tortured . He 'd be serving in the <entity id=5654>Brotherhood</entity> too , but they chose <entity id=5655>Beric</entity> as their leader , and they 're more like a family - and as a common-born tavern maiden 's son who was orphaned at a young age , <entity id=5656>Gendry</entity> has never had a family . <entity id=5657>Arya</entity> sadly chokes out that she could be his family . In response , <entity id=5658>Gendry</entity> politely but firmly points out that the class differences between them mean that if he goes back with her , they 'd never be family : he 'd still be a commoner , and she 'd be `` m'lady . `` . Later that night , <entity id=5659>Arya</entity> looks into the campfire and recites her nightly prayer-list for the death of her enemies . <entity id=5660>Thoros</entity> says that they plan to bring her to Riverrun to reunite her with her family , and in exchange for a reward from <entity id=5661>Robb</entity> to fund their cause . <entity id=5662>Arya</entity> points out that they are ransoming her , and <entity id=5663>Thoros</entity> admits they technically are , but this is different . They do intend to escort her safely through the war-ravaged countryside to her family , and <entity id=5664>Beric</entity> would like to return her for free out of memory of her father , but they really need the gold to support themselves . <entity id=5665>Beric</entity> says he knows she must be angry with him , but releasing <entity id=5666>Sandor</entity> was the right thing to do , as they 'd promised to let him go free if he won the trial by combat . <entity id=5667>Arya</entity> is still quietly upset , as she 's now seen many honorable men keep their promises and behave lawfully only to be killed for it ( such as <entity id=5668>Yoren</entity> and her own father ) . She wonders why <entity id=5669>Beric</entity> would want to let <entity id=5670>Sandor</entity> go when he nearly killed him , but <entity id=5669>Beric</entity> insists that he did actually kill him . When <entity id=5671>Arya</entity> asks how , <entity id=5672>Beric</entity> points her to Thoros to explain , but he says that he is n't the one who brings <entity id=5672>Beric</entity> back to life , it 's the <entity id=5673>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5674>Light</entity> , and <entity id=5675>Thoros</entity> is just the `` lucky drunk '' who recites the prayers . <entity id=5676>Beric</entity> opens his shirt to reveal several grievous scars on his torso : they explain that <entity id=5676>Beric</entity> has actually died and then been brought back to life six times now , counting his recent death in the trial by combat . He has been impaled on a lance , shot with an arrow , and at his fifth death the <entity id=5677>Lannisters</entity> hanged him for treason and stuck a dagger in his eye ( which did n't heal when <entity id=5678>Thoros</entity> brought him back ) . <entity id=5679>Arya</entity> earnestly asks <entity id=5680>Thoros</entity> if he could bring back to life a man without a head . Thoros and <entity id=5681>Beric</entity> both understand that she is asking about bringing back her father , but <entity id=5682>Thoros</entity> says he does n't think it works that way ( both because he was decapitated , and because he 's been dead for far too long by now ) . <entity id=5683>Beric</entity> consoles her that her father was a good man , but he would n't wish his resurrected life on him . <entity id=5684>Beric</entity> explains that being brought back from the dead carries a heavy toll , as pieces of his memory and who he was before chip away each time . <entity id=5685>Arya</entity> still says she would wish <entity id=5686>Beric</entity> 's life on her father , because at least <entity id=5686>Beric</entity> is still alive . At <entity id=5687>Dragonstone</entity> , King <entity id=5688>Stannis Baratheon</entity> is still deeply depressed after his defeat at the <entity id=5689>Battle</entity> of the <entity id=5690>Blackwater</entity> , and does n't have the daily support of the <entity id=5691>Red Priestess Melisandre</entity> since she left on what she claimed was an important mission . Most of <entity id=5692>Stannis</entity> ' army has been destroyed , and the only reason the Lannisters have n't attacked <entity id=5693>Dragonstone</entity> yet is because so much of their fleet was destroyed at <entity id=5694>Blackwater</entity> that they can not yet mount an amphibious assault . With little else to do , <entity id=5695>Stannis</entity> takes the time to visit his wife , <entity id=5696>Queen Selyse</entity> ( who was born into <entity id=5697>House Florent</entity> ) , for the first time since returning from the battle . He finds her in her chamber , praying over a fire to the <entity id=5698>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5699>Light</entity> : <entity id=5700>Selyse</entity> is a fanatical believer in the <entity id=5698>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5699>Light</entity> religion , far more so than <entity id=5701>Stannis</entity> , and it was indeed Selyse who first invited <entity id=5702>Melisandre</entity> to <entity id=5703>Dragonstone</entity> . <entity id=5704>Stannis</entity> and <entity id=5705>Selyse</entity> do not have a loving relationship , but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the <entity id=5706>Lord</entity> 's Chosen . She tells him not to despair despite his defeat , and he will be victorious , but he laments that he used to believe that once . Due to his extreme belief in duty , ( unlike his hedonistic brother <entity id=5707>Robert</entity> ) <entity id=5708>Stannis</entity> is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to <entity id=5709>Selyse</entity> , when he had sex with <entity id=5710>Melisandre</entity> to create the Shadow-assassin creature that killed Renly . He begins to confess to Selyse that he has sinned and shamed her , but she interrupts him and says <entity id=5711>Melisandre</entity> already told her everything - and that no act done in service of the <entity id=5712>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5713>Light</entity> can be a sin . Indeed , she wept for joy when <entity id=5714>Melisandre</entity> told her of this service she did for the <entity id=5715>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5716>Light</entity> with <entity id=5717>Stannis</entity> , and because the <entity id=5718>Red Priestess</entity> gave him a `` son '' ( of sorts ) which she never could . <entity id=5719>Stannis</entity> ' face is filled with a mix of shock , disgust , and relief . <entity id=5720>Selyse</entity> had three sons with <entity id=5721>Stannis</entity> but they were all stillborn , and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars . The deaths of her `` sweet boys '' and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected <entity id=5722>Selyse</entity> , and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the <entity id=5723>Lord</entity> of <entity id=5724>Light</entity> . She weeps , and laments that she has given <entity id=5725>Stannis</entity> nothing - he does not blame her , and with pity he says that 's not true . <entity id=5726>Selyse</entity> understands he is referring to their daughter and only child , <entity id=5727>Princess Shireen Baratheon</entity> . She grows annoyed when she realizes he 's come to see her too , and says he should n't waste time on such distractions , but insists that she is his daughter , and she relents because it is not her place to question her king . <entity id=5728>Shireen</entity> visits <entity id=5729>Davos</entity> while in the dungeons . <entity id=5730>Shireen</entity> is alone in her room drawing and singing a song about life under the sea to herself , and is excited to see her father . She is a cheerful but sickly young girl ( about the same age as <entity id=5731>Arya Stark</entity> ) , with the left side of her face badly scarred and disfigured by the dreaded <entity id=5732>Greyscale</entity> disease . <entity id=5733>Stannis</entity> wanted to see his daughter , but he is awkward in expressing warm emotions to her . She says she heard he was in a battle and asks if he won , and he good-naturedly says no . <entity id=5734>Shireen</entity> is slightly let-down , but asks if the <entity id=5735>Onion Knight</entity> came back as well : <entity id=5736>Ser Davos Seaworth</entity> has been her friend during his service to her father , and he even made her a toy ship . Growing tense over their falling out , <entity id=5737>Stannis</entity> briefly explains that <entity id=5738>Ser Davos</entity> is a traitor and is rotting in the dungeon . Confused , he flatly says she should best put him out of her mind . Later that night , <entity id=5739>Shireen</entity> sneaks down to the dungeon of <entity id=5740>Dragonstone</entity> and finds the cell of `` <entity id=5741>Ser Onion Knight</entity> . '' He wakes up and tells her she should n't be there , but she explains that the fat guard <entity id=5742>Bert</entity> is on duty , who usually drinks a lot of wine and sleeps through his watch . She asks if it is true that he is a traitor , and he says that it is , as he disobeyed her father . She says she does n't care , he 's her friend . She was worried that he must get bored down in his cell , so she brought him a book to read , about Aegon the <entity id=5743>Conquer</entity> and his dragons - she excitedly points out that the <entity id=5744>Targaryens</entity> built <entity id=5745>Dragonstone</entity> , and <entity id=5746>Aegon</entity> used to live in this very castle . <entity id=5747>Davos</entity> reluctantly explains that it 's wasted on him , because he does n't know how to read . Undaunted , <entity id=5748>Shireen</entity> offers to teach him how to read , by coming down to his cell and reading to him when <entity id=5749>Bert</entity> is on duty . <entity id=5750>Davos</entity> chides her that they ca n't , but she asks what 's the worst the guards could do to them if they find out , lock them in cells ? They have a quiet laugh , and <entity id=5751>Shireen</entity> starts to read to Davos An History of Aegon the <entity id=5752>Conqueror</entity> and His <entity id=5753>Conquest</entity> of <entity id=5754>Westeros</entity> . In <entity id=5755>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity id=5756>Queen Regent Cersei Lannister</entity> encounters <entity id=5757>Petyr</entity> `` Littlefinger '' <entity id=5758>Baelish</entity> in a courtyard , and tells him she fears that the <entity id=5759>Tyrells</entity> do not have the <entity id=5760>Lannisters</entity> ' best interests at heart , but her father wo n't listen . Therefore , she asks that <entity id=5761>Littlefinger</entity> use his spies to try to find out what they 're up to , because he has a good working relationship with them after brokering the Lannister-Tyrell alliance . He agrees , but <entity id=5762>Cersei</entity> warns him that this had better produce more results than when she previously asked him to find <entity id=5763>Arya Stark</entity> , but the girl could not be found . In the castle gardens , <entity id=5764>Sansa Stark</entity> and <entity id=5765>Margaery Tyrell</entity> watch her brother <entity id=5766>Ser Loras</entity> spar with his squire . <entity id=5767>Sansa</entity> confidently remarks on his fighting ability , and inquires when she and <entity id=5768>Loras</entity> will wed , as per the <entity id=5769>Tyrell</entity> plot to keep her out of the hands of <entity id=5770>Baelish</entity> and/or the <entity id=5771>Lannisters</entity> . <entity id=5772>Margaery</entity> replies that she will `` plant the seed '' of the idea after she and <entity id=5773>Joffrey</entity> are married . <entity id=5774>Sansa</entity> is skeptical <entity id=5775>Joffrey</entity> will let her go but <entity id=5776>Margaery</entity> is confident he will do it to please her , once she is his wife . After the match , <entity id=5777>Ser Loras</entity> ' new squire Olyvar flirts with him , which leads to them having sex back in <entity id=5778>Loras</entity> ' chambers . As they finish , <entity id=5779>Loras</entity> mentions that he is engaged to be married . a fact that <entity id=5780>Olyvar</entity> passes on to his real master , <entity id=5781>Littlefinger</entity> , so he can pass the information on to <entity id=5782>Cersei</entity> . Loras and <entity id=5783>Olyvar</entity> . A short time later , <entity id=5784>Littlefinger</entity> meets with <entity id=5785>Sansa</entity> , offering her a place on his ship that will take him from the capital to the <entity id=5786>Vale</entity> of <entity id=5787>Arryn</entity> . <entity id=5788>Sansa</entity> practices lying for a change , and tells him that they should wait until after <entity id=5789>Joffrey</entity> 's wedding , primarily because she fears for his safety if the plan fails . A master manipulator , <entity id=5790>Littlefinger</entity> is clearly suspicious of her motives , but does n't press the matter for the moment . Instead he says he is touched by her concern for his safety , and insists that she call him `` Petyr . `` . At the same time , <entity id=5791>Tyrion Lannister</entity> is engaged in a meeting with <entity id=5792>Lady Olenna Tyrell</entity> ; with the upcoming royal wedding shaping up to be an extravagant and expensive affair , <entity id=5793>Tyrion</entity> is concerned about the cost . <entity id=5794>Olenna</entity> points out that the <entity id=5795>Tyrells</entity> have done much to supply the city with soldiers and provisions to assist in the war effort , as well as the coming winter . <entity id=5796>Olenna</entity> is bored to discuss financial matters , but quickly lists off specific details of the soldiers and supplies the Tyrells are supplying to aid the crown , demonstrating that <entity id=5797>Tyrion</entity> does n't need to lecture her about wartime expenses . She insists that the royal wedding must go on as planned , as it will do much to improve the city 's morale and keep the people happy , otherwise they will start blaming the <entity id=5798>Lannisters</entity> for the war again . <entity id=5799>Tyrion</entity> can not outmaneuver <entity id=5800>Olenna</entity> , but in the end she decides on her own that she wo n't have it said <entity id=5801>House Tyrell</entity> is n't doing its part to help , so she agrees to pay for half the cost of the festivities , for which <entity id=5799>Tyrion</entity> is grateful . <entity id=5802>Tyrion</entity> heads to the <entity id=5803>Small Council</entity> chamber to report success to his father <entity id=5804>Tywin</entity> , only to find <entity id=5805>Cersei</entity> present as well , much to his annoyance . <entity id=5806>Tywin</entity> explains that the Tyrells are plotting to wed <entity id=5807>Sansa</entity> to <entity id=5808>Ser Loras</entity> and states that he will not allow them to steal `` the key to the north '' out from under him . <entity id=5809>Tyrion</entity> questions how <entity id=5810>Sansa</entity> is the key to the <entity id=5811>North</entity> , given that her older brother is still alive . <entity id=5812>Tywin</entity> explains that the desertion of the <entity id=5813>Karstarks</entity> have cost <entity id=5814>Robb Stark</entity> half his army , and ( combined with already being badly outnumbered by the Lannister-Tyrell alliance ) his days are now numbered . Theon <entity id=5815>Greyjoy</entity> murdered <entity id=5816>Robb</entity> 's younger brothers at <entity id=5817>Winterfell</entity> , which makes <entity id=5818>Sansa Robb</entity> 's heir : if he dies , rule of <entity id=5817>Winterfell</entity> and the <entity id=5819>North</entity> goes to her and any man she marries . which <entity id=5820>Tywin</entity> has no intention of letting the <entity id=5821>Tyrells</entity> get their hands on . <entity id=5822>Tyrion</entity> questions if it is wise to offend their allies by refusing the match , but <entity id=5823>Tywin</entity> points out that as a plot against them , the <entity id=5824>Tyrells</entity> ' plan is , by definition , a secret , thus the <entity id=5825>Lannisters</entity> ca n't be said to be `` refusing '' them something which they are n't officially trying to do . He also notes that the <entity id=5826>Tyrells</entity> wo n't go through with their plan until after <entity id=5827>Joffrey</entity> 's wedding , which means they need to act first . namely by finding <entity id=5828>Sansa</entity> another husband . After a moment , <entity id=5829>Tyrion</entity> realizes from the comments of his father and sister that they are talking about him . <entity id=5830>Tyrion</entity> tries to protest , pointing out that <entity id=5831>Joffrey</entity> has made <entity id=5832>Sansa</entity> 's life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force <entity id=5830>Tyrion</entity> on her after she has finally escaped <entity id=5831>Joffrey</entity> is cruel , even by <entity id=5833>Tywin</entity> 's standards . <entity id=5834>Tywin</entity> questions if <entity id=5835>Tyrion</entity> plans to mistreat <entity id=5836>Sansa</entity> and asserts that he is not concerned with the girl 's happiness and neither should his son . <entity id=5837>Tyrion</entity> protests that <entity id=5838>Sansa</entity> is a child , but <entity id=5839>Cersei</entity> counters she has flowered and is a woman now who can bear children . <entity id=5840>Tyrion</entity> flatly refuses , but <entity id=5841>Tywin</entity> points out that recently he was complaining that he was n't rewarded for his actions in the <entity id=5842>Battle</entity> of the <entity id=5843>Blackwater</entity> , and as heiress to the <entity id=5844>North</entity> , <entity id=5845>Sansa</entity> is a far better reward than he could expect , and in any case , it is long past time <entity id=5840>Tyrion</entity> was wed. At this , <entity id=5840>Tyrion</entity> snarls that he was wed , referring to his past marriage to <entity id=5846>Tysha</entity> , asking if his father has forgotten that . Returning his son 's hateful glare with one of his own , <entity id=5847>Tywin</entity> retorts that he remembers all too well . <entity id=5848>Tywin</entity> arranges some marriages . <entity id=5849>Cersei</entity> gloats over the matter , but her smug attitude quickly evaporates when her father commands that she will wed <entity id=5850>Ser Loras</entity> instead . <entity id=5851>Cersei</entity> flatly refuses , but <entity id=5852>Tywin</entity> is insistent : the marriages of <entity id=5851>Cersei</entity> and <entity id=5853>Tyrion</entity> will place the <entity id=5854>North</entity> and the Reach firmly in the <entity id=5855>Lannisters</entity> ' control . <entity id=5856>Tywin</entity> points out that <entity id=5857>Cersei</entity> is still fertile : she needs to marry and `` breed . '' When <entity id=5858>Cersei</entity> protests she is <entity id=5859>Queen Regent</entity> and not a brood mare , <entity id=5860>Tywin</entity> angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told : she will marry <entity id=5861>Loras</entity> and in so doing , put an end to what <entity id=5860>Tywin</entity> calls `` the disgusting rumors '' <entity id=5862>Stannis</entity> has been spreading about her and Jaime . <entity id=5863>Cersei</entity> switches to earnestly begging him , calling him `` father '' and pleading that he not force her into an arranged marriage a second time ( after her long and loveless marriage with King <entity id=5864>Robert</entity> ) . <entity id=5865>Tywin</entity> refuses to listen and storms out in disgust , raging that the pair have disgraced the <entity id=5866>Lannister</entity> name for far too long . <entity id=5867>Cersei</entity> slowly shifts her gaze toward <entity id=5868>Tyrion</entity> to gauge his reaction to her distress but sees he is too glum about his own predicament .
