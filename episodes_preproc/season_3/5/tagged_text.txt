The <entity class="NE" id=5202>Hound</entity> is judged by the gods ; Jaime is judged ; <entity class="NE" id=5203>Jon</entity> proves himself ; <entity class="NE" id=5204>Robb</entity> is betrayed ; <entity class="NE" id=5205>Tyrion</entity> learns the cost of weddings . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=5206>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5207>Tormund</entity> warns <entity class="NE" id=5208>Jon</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5209>Jon Jon</entity> is with the group of twenty wildlings under the command of <entity class="NE" id=5210>Tormund</entity> , who were sent ahead of the main army of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder to scale the <entity class="NE" id=5211>Wall</entity> and attack <entity class="NE" id=5212>Castle Black</entity> from behind . <entity class="NE" id=5213>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5214>Ygritte</entity> are gathering firewood , when the warg <entity class="NE" id=5215>Orell</entity> asks him about the defenses of the <entity class="NE" id=5216>Night's Watch</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5217>Orell</entity> has seen through the eyes of his eagle that there are patrols on top of the <entity class="NE" id=5218>Wall</entity> and he wants to know how frequent they are . <entity class="NE" id=5219>Jon</entity> says they usually sent out patrols in teams of four , two builders to inspect for structural damage and two rangers to protect them , but that the frequency of their patrols often changes . <entity class="NE" id=5220>Orell</entity> says the wildlings know there are nineteen castles along the south side of the <entity class="NE" id=5221>Wall</entity> , but he wants to know how many are currently manned . <entity class="NE" id=5222>Jon</entity> finds this very unpleasant , but reluctantly says that only three are currently manned . Apart from <entity class="NE" id=5223>Castle Black</entity> ( which even the wildlings know is manned ) , there is also Eastwatch-by-the-Sea at the extreme eastern end , and The <entity class="NE" id=5224>Shadow Tower</entity> at the western end . <entity class="NE" id=5225>Jon</entity> is then asked how many men currently garrison <entity class="NE" id=5226>Castle Black</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5227>Jon</entity> is very reluctant to answer , but after being threatened by <entity class="NE" id=5228>Orell</entity> , he gives an exaggerated number , saying there are one thousand men ( this is a lie , as <entity class="NE" id=5229>Castle Black</entity> only had six hundred men before the <entity class="NE" id=5230>Great Ranging</entity> , and the garrison now is closer to three hundred ) . <entity class="NE" id=5231>Tormund</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=5232>Jon</entity> that he likes him , but if he 's lying to them , he 'll rip his guts out through his throat . <entity class="NE" id=5233>Ygritte</entity> is caught off-guard when <entity class="NE" id=5234>Jon</entity> begins performing oral sex on her . <entity class="NE" id=5235>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5236>Ygritte</entity> then walk away , but she steals his sword <entity class="NE" id=5237>Longclaw</entity> , making him chase her to get it back . She leads him into a nearby cave , which is heated by natural hotsprings , which form a waterfall and a pool . <entity class="NE" id=5238>Ygritte</entity> starts disrobing , and says that she wants to make sure <entity class="NE" id=5239>Jon Snow</entity> has truly come over to the wildlings ' side and broken his <entity class="NE" id=5240>Night's Watch</entity> vows - by making him break his oath of celibacy with her . She quickly shucks off all of her clothes and walks up to him naked . <entity class="NE" id=5241>Jon</entity> is very hesitant to break his vows , and very shy because he 's never had sex before . <entity class="NE" id=5242>Ygritte</entity> questions why he 's still dressed , and they start kissing . <entity class="NE" id=5243>Jon</entity> continues to kiss down her body as she insists that he has no experience and therefore `` You know nothing , <entity class="NE" id=5244>Jon Sn</entity> -- '' but stops mid-word as <entity class="NE" id=5243>Jon</entity> starts performing oral sex on her . <entity class="NE" id=5245>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5246>Ygritte</entity> taking a bath after sex . Some time after they finish having sex , they lie together in a naked embrace . <entity class="NE" id=5247>Ygritte</entity> asks if `` that thing you did with your mouth '' is what Lords do to their Ladies in the south , but <entity class="NE" id=5248>Jon</entity> says she just seemed to like it when he kissed her there . He admits he 's never had sex with anyone before and is `` a maid '' , though <entity class="NE" id=5249>Ygritte</entity> starts listing off some wildling boys she 's had sex with before . The first was a boy who also had red hair like her , which is rare among the wildlings and considered very lucky : they call having red hair being `` kissed by fire '' , and another was a Thenn that was `` built like an ox '' , but he could not speak the <entity class="NE" id=5250>Common Tongue</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5251>Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5252>Ygritte</entity> then slide into the hot springs pool to take a bath together and romantically cuddle more . <entity class="NE" id=5253>Ygritte</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=5254>Jon</entity> she wishes they could stay in this cave forever ( instead of having to leave and face the winter , wars , and monsters outside ) . Across the <entity class="NE" id=5255>Narrow Sea</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=5256>Slaver</entity> 's <entity class="NE" id=5257>Bay</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5258>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> 's new army of freed <entity class="NE" id=5259>Unsullied</entity> , having just sacked <entity class="NE" id=5260>Astapor</entity> , head north to the next of the three great slaver-cities , <entity class="NE" id=5261>Yunkai</entity> . Ser Ser tells <entity class="NE" id=5262>Ser Barristan Selmy</entity> how he was knighted at the end of the <entity class="NE" id=5263>Greyjoy Rebellion</entity> , in which they both fought . <entity class="NE" id=5264>Jorah</entity> explains that he was the second man through the breach during the <entity class="NE" id=5265>Siege</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5266>Pyke</entity> , right behind <entity class="NE" id=5267>Thoros</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5268>Myr</entity> , who charged in headlong waving about his flaming sword . <entity class="NE" id=5269>Barristan</entity> thinks this is amusing as he was n't there ( he was commanding the <entity class="NE" id=5270>Siege</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5271>Old Wyk</entity> at the time ) . King <entity class="NE" id=5272>Robert Baratheon</entity> himself knighted <entity class="NE" id=5273>Jorah</entity> for his bravery that day , the proudest of <entity class="NE" id=5273>Jorah</entity> 's life , though he says what he was most thinking about was that he really needed to piss because he 'd been sealed in metal plate armor for sixteen hours straight . <entity class="NE" id=5274>Barristan</entity> admits that <entity class="NE" id=5275>Robert</entity> was a good man and a good warrior , but laments that he turned out to be a terrible king . <entity class="NE" id=5276>Barristan</entity> laments that he wasted so much of his life defending kings who did n't deserve it ; seventeen years defending <entity class="NE" id=5277>Robert</entity> , and the <entity class="NE" id=5278>Mad King K N</entity> before that . <entity class="NE" id=5279>Barristan</entity> explains that a man of honor must keep his vows no matter what , whether he 's serving a drunk or a lunatic ( the reason why he never turned on King Aerys the way <entity class="NE" id=5280>Jaime Lannister</entity> ultimately did ) . <entity class="NE" id=5281>Barristan</entity> says that just once before he dies , he wants to know what it 's like to serve with pride , fighting for someone he believes in . Their talk turns to <entity class="NE" id=5282>Daenerys</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=5283>Jorah</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=5284>Barristan</entity> can believe in her . <entity class="NE" id=5285>Barristan</entity> says she 'll have good men to advise her , though he respectfully warns that it might not be well for her to be seen with <entity class="NE" id=5286>Jorah</entity> at her side when they return to <entity class="NE" id=5287>Westeros</entity> ; <entity class="NE" id=5286>Jorah</entity> admits that he may never be rid of the moral taint of selling slaves , which is abhorred in <entity class="NE" id=5287>Westeros</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5288>Jorah</entity> then begins to subtly ask about the advisors on the <entity class="NE" id=5289>Small Council</entity> , if any of them spoke against <entity class="NE" id=5290>Robert</entity> when he wanted <entity class="NE" id=5291>Daenerys</entity> , the last Targaryen , assassinated . It becomes apparent that <entity class="NE" id=5292>Jorah</entity> is trying to figure out if <entity class="NE" id=5293>Barristan</entity> knew that <entity class="NE" id=5292>Jorah</entity> was initially a spy for King <entity class="NE" id=5294>Robert</entity> , reporting back to <entity class="NE" id=5295>Varys</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5296>Jorah</entity> 's report that <entity class="NE" id=5297>Daenerys</entity> was pregnant is what made <entity class="NE" id=5298>Robert</entity> demand that <entity class="NE" id=5297>Daenerys</entity> be assassinated at a <entity class="NE" id=5299>Small Council</entity> meeting with <entity class="NE" id=5300>Ned Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5301>Jorah</entity> points out that the <entity class="NE" id=5302>Lord Commander</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=5303>Kingsguard</entity> traditionally holds a seat on the <entity class="NE" id=5304>Small Council</entity> . However , <entity class="NE" id=5305>Barristan</entity> explains that as a former <entity class="NE" id=5306>Kingsguard</entity> member under <entity class="NE" id=5307>Aerys Targaryen</entity> , and one who 'd killed several of <entity class="NE" id=5308>Robert</entity> 's friends , while <entity class="NE" id=5308>Robert</entity> did n't mind keeping him in his position as a guard , he never really trusted his advice , so he left him out of <entity class="NE" id=5309>Small Council</entity> meetings . <entity class="NE" id=5310>Jorah</entity> is relieved that <entity class="NE" id=5311>Barristan</entity> was therefore not present at any council meeting so he could n't have learned that <entity class="NE" id=5310>Jorah</entity> was sending it reports on <entity class="NE" id=5312>Daenerys</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5313>Jorah</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5314>Barristan</entity> briefly bicker about the fact that <entity class="NE" id=5314>Barristan</entity> only just came to them , while <entity class="NE" id=5313>Jorah</entity> was defending <entity class="NE" id=5315>Daenerys</entity> from <entity class="NE" id=5316>Robert Baratheon</entity> 's assassins for months , and <entity class="NE" id=5314>Barristan</entity> is n't <entity class="NE" id=5317>Lord Commander</entity> here ; <entity class="NE" id=5313>Jorah</entity> takes his orders from <entity class="NE" id=5315>Daenerys</entity> . Meanwhile , <entity class="NE" id=5318>Daenerys</entity> and her translator/aide-de-camp Missandei meet with the assembled officers of the <entity class="NE" id=5319>Unsullied</entity> . She addresses them in <entity class="NE" id=5320>Low Valyrian</entity> , and says that now that they are no longer slaves but free men and they can make their own choices , and she asked them to choose one among them to be leader of all the <entity class="NE" id=5321>Unsullied</entity> . They part ranks and one of the eunuchs steps forward . She asks him to remove his helmet and tell her his name , and he introduces himself as `` <entity class="NE" id=5322>Grey Worm</entity> '' . <entity class="NE" id=5323>Daenerys</entity> is confused , and <entity class="NE" id=5324>Missandei</entity> explains that when the slavemasters of <entity class="NE" id=5325>Astapor</entity> castrate slave-boys to train them as Unsullied , they force new slave-names onto them which are intentionally demeaning , usually a combination of a color and a kind of vermin , i.e . `` <entity class="NE" id=5326>Grey Worm</entity> '' , `` Red Flea '' , `` <entity class="NE" id=5327>Black Rat</entity> '' , etc . This is to enforce the mentality in the Unsullied that this is just what they are : worthless , expendable vermin . Disgusted , <entity class="NE" id=5328>Daenerys</entity> issues the command that all Unsullied must choose their own new names as free men , or reclaim the names their parents gave them . The <entity class="NE" id=5329>Unsullied</entity> commander says that he will continue to be known as `` <entity class="NE" id=5330>Grey Worm</entity> '' : his original name is accursed , because it was the name he had when he was taken as a slave , but `` <entity class="NE" id=5330>Grey Worm</entity> '' is a lucky name he will bear with pride , because it is the name he had when he was set free by <entity class="NE" id=5331>Daenerys Stormborn</entity> of <entity class="HSE" id=5332>House Targaryen</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5333>Daenerys</entity> is deeply touched by his loyalty . In the <entity class="NE" id=5334>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=5335>Riverrun</entity> , the prisoners <entity class="NE" id=5336>Martyn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5337>Willem Lannister</entity> ( squires fifteen and fourteen years old , respectively ) awake to hear shouting and fighting outside the door to their cell . <entity class="NE" id=5338>Lord Lord</entity> fights his way into the room with some of his own men . Confused , <entity class="NE" id=5339>Willem</entity> asks if this is a rescue , and is promptly killed by the <entity class="NE" id=5340>Karstark</entity> men . <entity class="NE" id=5341>Martyn</entity> begs that he is just a squire and did n't do anything , but <entity class="NE" id=5342>Lord Rickard</entity> ignores his pleas and stabs him in the belly with a dagger , killing him . <entity class="NE" id=5343>Martyn</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5344>Willem</entity> lie dead before <entity class="NE" id=5345>Robb</entity> . The bloody corpses of the two Lannister prisoners are laid out on the floor in front of King in the <entity class="NE" id=5346>North Robb Stark</entity> in <entity class="NE" id=5347>Riverrun</entity> 's main meeting room . <entity class="NE" id=5348>Robb</entity> is disgusted , remarking that <entity class="NE" id=5349>Karstark</entity> needed five men to brutally murder two unarmed squires in their own prison cell . <entity class="NE" id=5350>Karstark</entity> insists that it was a father 's vengeance . <entity class="NE" id=5351>Robb</entity> points out that these boys had nothing to do with the death of <entity class="NE" id=5352>Karstark</entity> 's sons , who were both killed by <entity class="NE" id=5353>Jaime Lannister</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5354>Rickard</entity> explains that he was denied his vengeance when <entity class="NE" id=5355>Robb</entity> 's mother <entity class="NE" id=5356>Catelyn</entity> set <entity class="NE" id=5357>Jaime</entity> free in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in <entity class="NE" id=5358>King</entity> 's Landing . Finally having enough , <entity class="NE" id=5359>Karstark</entity> did the next best thing , and killed <entity class="NE" id=5360>Jaime</entity> 's kin who they held prisoner . <entity class="NE" id=5361>Robb</entity> angrily shouts that they were only little boys , and <entity class="NE" id=5362>Karstark</entity> ca n't blame <entity class="NE" id=5363>Catelyn</entity> for his treasonous killing of prisoners of war . <entity class="NE" id=5364>Karstark</entity> stands firm , and says the only treason is in letting their enemies go , when in war they should be killing them - if <entity class="NE" id=5365>Robb</entity> 's father ever taught him that . <entity class="NE" id=5366>Brynden Brynden</entity> punches <entity class="NE" id=5367>Karstark</entity> over this remark , but <entity class="NE" id=5368>Robb</entity> tells him to leave <entity class="NE" id=5367>Karstark</entity> alone . <entity class="NE" id=5369>Karstark</entity> has utterly lost faith in <entity class="NE" id=5370>Robb</entity> , and says that the King in the <entity class="NE" id=5371>North</entity> will just give him a scolding , though he should probably call him `` the King Who Lost the <entity class="NE" id=5371>North</entity> '' after he allowed <entity class="NE" id=5372>Winterfell</entity> to fall . <entity class="NE" id=5373>Robb</entity> orders all of <entity class="NE" id=5374>Karstark</entity> 's men hanged , and to hang the lookout last so he can watch the others die . <entity class="NE" id=5375>Rickard Rickard</entity> himself is sent to the dungeons . <entity class="NE" id=5376>Robb</entity> 's uncle <entity class="NE" id=5377>Edmure Tully</entity> insists that if word of this leaves <entity class="NE" id=5378>Riverrun</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5379>Tywin Lannister</entity> will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews . Therefore , he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys , and simply keep silent about their deaths until the war is over . <entity class="NE" id=5380>Robb</entity> , however , refuses to be a liar : he says he can not fight a war in the name of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks . All of <entity class="NE" id=5381>Robb</entity> 's advisors tell him this is a bad idea . <entity class="NE" id=5382>Catelyn</entity> and his wife <entity class="NE" id=5383>Talisa</entity> warn him that the <entity class="NE" id=5384>Karstark</entity> soldiers will abandon his cause and return home if he executes their lord , and they are already badly outnumbered . <entity class="NE" id=5385>Catelyn</entity> says they should keep <entity class="NE" id=5386>Lord Rickard</entity> hostage , and <entity class="NE" id=5387>Edmure</entity> agrees , saying that they can just keep him hostage and tell the other Karstarks that no harm will come to him so long as they remain loyal . <entity class="NE" id=5388>Robb</entity> executes <entity class="NE" id=5389>Rickard</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5390>Robb</entity> ignores their pleas , and he has <entity class="NE" id=5391>Lord Karstark</entity> brought out to the courtyard of <entity class="NE" id=5392>Riverrun</entity> to be executed during a driving rainstorm . <entity class="NE" id=5393>Karstark</entity> points out that not only are both of their Houses descended from the <entity class="NE" id=5394>First Men</entity> , but the <entity class="NE" id=5395>Starks</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5396>Karstarks</entity> are kin ( as <entity class="HSE" id=5397>House Karstark</entity> is a cadet branch of <entity class="HSE" id=5398>House Stark</entity> , founded centuries ago by younger son <entity class="NE" id=5399>Karlon Stark</entity> ) . <entity class="NE" id=5400>Robb</entity> says that their blood relationship did not stop <entity class="NE" id=5401>Rickard</entity> from betraying him and wo n't stop <entity class="NE" id=5400>Robb</entity> from executing him now , but <entity class="NE" id=5401>Rickard</entity> says it is n't meant to : he wants it to haunt <entity class="NE" id=5400>Robb</entity> until the day he dies . With his last words , <entity class="NE" id=5402>Lord Rickard</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=5403>Robb</entity> will be cursed ( as a kinslayer ) and that <entity class="NE" id=5403>Robb</entity> is no king of his . <entity class="NE" id=5404>Obedient</entity> to the laws of his father <entity class="NE" id=5405>Eddard Stark</entity> - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - <entity class="NE" id=5406>Robb</entity> pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads <entity class="NE" id=5407>Lord Rickard</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5408>Robb</entity> 's strict adherence to justice makes things turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would : the <entity class="NE" id=5409>Karstarks</entity> withdraw their soldiers from his army and march for home , resulting in <entity class="NE" id=5408>Robb</entity> losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at <entity class="NE" id=5410>Riverrun</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5411>Robb</entity> openly admits to Talisa that she was right , and he made a mistake . <entity class="NE" id=5412>Robb</entity> says <entity class="NE" id=5413>Tywin Lannister</entity> realizes that he 's in such a strong position he does n't even need to attack the <entity class="NE" id=5414>Northerners</entity> anymore , he just needs to wait , and let their demoralized forces unravel . When the war began <entity class="NE" id=5415>Robb</entity> 's army was unified around a central purpose , but now they have lost momentum , and his generals are acting like bickering children . <entity class="NE" id=5416>Robb</entity> shows <entity class="NE" id=5417>Talisa</entity> a war map of the <entity class="NE" id=5418>Seven Kingdoms</entity> - depicting <entity class="NE" id=5416>Robb</entity> 's armies concentrated around <entity class="NE" id=5419>Riverrun</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5420>Harrenhal</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5421>Lannister</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5422>Tyrell</entity> armies overrunning the <entity class="NE" id=5423>Stormlands</entity> , Lannister/Tyrell armies concentrated in <entity class="NE" id=5424>King</entity> 's Landing , and <entity class="NE" id=5425>Greyjoy</entity> forces occupying the western coasts of the <entity class="NE" id=5426>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5427>Talisa</entity> suggests that he try to take the fight to the <entity class="NE" id=5428>Lannisters</entity> if they wo n't come to him , but he explains that this is hopeless . Taking <entity class="NE" id=5429>King</entity> 's Landing would have been difficult to begin with , but now <entity class="NE" id=5430>Tywin</entity> and the bulk of the main Lannister army , as well as a large <entity class="NE" id=5431>Tyrell</entity> army , are defending the city . Attacking the capital head-on would be suicide , and <entity class="NE" id=5432>Tywin</entity> would crush them within a day . <entity class="NE" id=5433>Talisa</entity> suggests that he lead his army back to the <entity class="NE" id=5434>North</entity> to repulse the <entity class="NE" id=5435>Greyjoys</entity> from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase . <entity class="NE" id=5436>Robb</entity> points out that as soon as all of his tired soldiers are back home , they wo n't want to leave again - particularly because `` winter is coming , '' and the coming one is expected to be very long , five years or more . The Northerners have been away from their farms fighting in the war , however , so they have n't even begun to collect harvests to set aside as winter stockpiles . Thus if <entity class="NE" id=5437>Robb</entity> returns to the <entity class="NE" id=5438>North</entity> , it will be difficult to rally his men to return south to defend the Riverlords who declared for him . Eyeing the map with <entity class="NE" id=5439>Talisa</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5440>Robb</entity> decides that if <entity class="NE" id=5441>King</entity> 's Landing is too strong to attack and he ca n't return home , his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest . <entity class="NE" id=5442>Robb</entity> decides that with the main Lannister army-group under <entity class="NE" id=5443>Tywin</entity> now positioned all the way to the east in <entity class="NE" id=5444>King</entity> 's Landing , he needs to return to the <entity class="NE" id=5445>Westerlands</entity> and make an all-or-nothing assault against <entity class="NE" id=5446>Casterly Rock</entity> . This will make the <entity class="NE" id=5447>Lannisters</entity> lose face , just as <entity class="NE" id=5448>Robb</entity> did when he lost his home castle of <entity class="NE" id=5449>Winterfell</entity> , and bring momentum back to his army . However , with the loss of the <entity class="NE" id=5450>Karstark</entity> forces , they do n't currently have enough men to consider attacking <entity class="NE" id=5451>Casterly Rock</entity> . The only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if <entity class="NE" id=5452>Robb</entity> can win back the allegiance of <entity class="HSE" id=5453>House Frey</entity> , whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from <entity class="NE" id=5452>Robb</entity> 's army when he broke his promise to make a marriage-alliance with them by marrying <entity class="NE" id=5454>Talisa</entity> , a political nobody , instead of one of the <entity class="NE" id=5455>Lord Walder Frey</entity> 's daughters . Thus , <entity class="NE" id=5456>Robb</entity> must try to repair his alliance with <entity class="HSE" id=5457>House Frey</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5458>Locke</entity> taunting <entity class="NE" id=5459>Jaime</entity> about his hand . At <entity class="NE" id=5460>Harrenhal</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5461>Locke</entity> presents the captive Jaime Lannister and <entity class="NE" id=5462>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5463>Tarth</entity> to the <entity class="NE" id=5464>Northern</entity> castellan , <entity class="NE" id=5465>Lord Roose Bolton</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5466>Locke</entity> is quite proud of himself for his torture of <entity class="NE" id=5467>Jaime</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=5468>Roose</entity> is surprised that <entity class="NE" id=5467>Jaime</entity> has lost his hand . <entity class="NE" id=5469>Oblivious</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5470>Locke</entity> boasts that <entity class="NE" id=5471>Jaime</entity> has n't `` lost '' the hand , and points out that he cut it off and hung <entity class="NE" id=5471>Jaime</entity> 's own hand around his neck . <entity class="NE" id=5472>Angered</entity> that <entity class="NE" id=5473>Locke</entity> maimed such a valuable hostage , <entity class="NE" id=5474>Bolton</entity> demands that he dispose of <entity class="NE" id=5475>Jaime</entity> 's rotting hand , and orders that accommodations be provided for the pair of prisoners . When <entity class="NE" id=5476>Jaime</entity> asks if there is news from the capital , <entity class="NE" id=5477>Bolton</entity> informs him that <entity class="NE" id=5478>Stannis Baratheon</entity> laid siege to the city in the <entity class="NE" id=5479>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=5480>Blackwater</entity> . then needlessly drags out revealing the result . <entity class="NE" id=5481>Bolton</entity> toys with Jaime but remains completely calm , never even grinning , before finally revealing that his sister <entity class="NE" id=5482>Cersei</entity> is alive and well , and his father 's forces successfully repulsed <entity class="NE" id=5483>Stannis</entity> 's assault . <entity class="NE" id=5484>Jaime</entity> is so overcome by delirium and relief that his family is safe that he collapses . <entity class="NE" id=5485>Bolton</entity> calls for <entity class="NE" id=5486>Qyburn</entity> to attend to <entity class="NE" id=5487>Jaime</entity> 's injuries . Later , <entity class="NE" id=5488>Qyburn</entity> peels away the crude tourniquet that <entity class="NE" id=5489>Locke</entity> 's men applied to <entity class="NE" id=5490>Jaime</entity> , and finds that the stump of his right arm has become badly infected . <entity class="NE" id=5491>Jaime</entity> asks if he will die , and <entity class="NE" id=5492>Qyburn</entity> says he wo n't , but the corruption has spread to the point that it would be safest just to amputate the rest of his right arm at the shoulder . Half-delirious from the infection , <entity class="NE" id=5493>Jaime</entity> refuses , and says he 'll kill <entity class="NE" id=5494>Qyburn</entity> if he tries . Jaime then notices that <entity class="NE" id=5495>Qyburn</entity> is not a Maester , because he is n't wearing a maester 's chain of office . <entity class="NE" id=5496>Qyburn</entity> acknowledges this , explaining that he was stripped of his chain by the <entity class="NE" id=5497>Citadel</entity> and thrown out of the Order of <entity class="NE" id=5498>Maesters</entity> , because as he says , he was conducting experiments which they felt were `` too bold . '' <entity class="NE" id=5499>Qyburn</entity> gets ready to cut <entity class="NE" id=5500>Jaime</entity> , and says he 'll at least try to save his elbow , but with a sudden burst of effort <entity class="NE" id=5500>Jaime</entity> grabs him around the throat with his left hand , and says he does n't need his right hand to kill him . <entity class="NE" id=5501>Qyburn</entity> relents , and says he could try cutting out the chunks of flesh which are outright rotten , then burning out the wounds with boiling wine , and with luck this might be able to stop the infection without having to amputate more of <entity class="NE" id=5502>Jaime</entity> 's arm above the wrist . <entity class="NE" id=5503>Jaime</entity> says he 's willing to try this , but <entity class="NE" id=5504>Qyburn</entity> cautions that it will cause a great amount of pain so he needs to give him Milk of the <entity class="NE" id=5505>Poppy</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=5503>Jaime</entity> refuses to take it , and says he 'll just scream . <entity class="NE" id=5506>Qyburn</entity> cautions him that it will cause a massive amount of pain , but <entity class="NE" id=5507>Jaime</entity> says that he will just scream loudly . <entity class="NE" id=5508>Qyburn</entity> begins to dig into the stump of <entity class="NE" id=5509>Jaime</entity> 's arm to cut out the gangrenous tissue , and <entity class="NE" id=5509>Jaime</entity> howls in agony . Some time later , <entity class="NE" id=5510>Brienne</entity> is in <entity class="NE" id=5511>Harrenhal</entity> 's bathhouse , scrubbing off weeks ' worth of caked on grime and filth from the trek through the <entity class="NE" id=5512>Riverlands</entity> . Jaime then appears in the doorway assisted by a servant , barely able to stand due to the pain he is in . He asks the servant to help him take off his muddy rags and leave . Jaime then walks naked into the same communal bath that <entity class="NE" id=5513>Brienne</entity> is in , on the far side . She is also naked and angrily points out that there are other baths , but he says he wants this one ; he 's afraid he 's going to pass out at any moment , and wants her to save him from drowning if he does , because he does n't want to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub . <entity class="NE" id=5514>Brienne</entity> asks why she should care how he dies , but he points out that she swore a solemn vow to get him to <entity class="NE" id=5515>King</entity> 's Landing in one piece - which ( indicating the stump of his hand ) has not been going so well . <entity class="NE" id=5516>Jaime</entity> quips that it 's no wonder Renly died with <entity class="NE" id=5517>Brienne</entity> guarding him , at which she defiantly stands up out of the bath , facing him fully nude , to show him she is n't afraid of him . Jaime gravely says that was `` unworthy '' and asks for forgiveness , <entity class="NE" id=5518>Brienne</entity> angrily orders him not to mock her , but he insists he 's seriously apologizing . Exhausted , <entity class="NE" id=5519>Jaime</entity> says he 's tired of fighting and just wants to have a truce ; <entity class="NE" id=5520>Brienne</entity> says you need trust to have a truce , but he says he trusts her , so she sits back down . Jaime recounts Aerys 's madness . Jaime then notes that <entity class="NE" id=5521>Brienne</entity> has the same look on her face that he 's seen on countless faces in the past seventeen years : people that despise him , call him `` kingslayer '' more than his own name , or `` oathbreaker '' and `` a man without honor . '' Jaime then goes on to recall the <entity class="NE" id=5522>Mad King's</entity> obsession with wildfire , how <entity class="NE" id=5523>Aerys</entity> enjoyed watching people being burned alive . <entity class="NE" id=5524>Jaime</entity> recalls <entity class="NE" id=5525>Aerys</entity> burned lords he did n't like , <entity class="NE" id=5526>Hands</entity> who failed him , and anyone he thought was against him . Ultimately , half of <entity class="NE" id=5527>Westeros</entity> rebelled against him , so <entity class="NE" id=5528>Aerys</entity> had his pyromancers place caches of wildfire all over <entity class="NE" id=5529>King</entity> 's Landing : under the <entity class="NE" id=5530>Great Sept</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5531>Baelor</entity> , under the slums of <entity class="NE" id=5532>Flea Bottom</entity> , under houses , stables , taverns , and even under the <entity class="NE" id=5533>Red Keep</entity> itself . After Robert's victory at the Trident he marched on the capital city , but <entity class="NE" id=5534>Jaime</entity> 's father <entity class="NE" id=5535>Tywin</entity> arrived there first , leading the entire Lannister army , and promising to defend the city . Jaime warned Aerys that his father was never a man to choose the losing side , that this must be a trick and he should surrender the city while he still could , but the <entity class="NE" id=5536>Mad King</entity> refused to listen . Nor did <entity class="NE" id=5537>Aerys</entity> listen to Varys when he gave the same warning that <entity class="NE" id=5538>Tywin</entity> could n't be trusted - but he did listen to <entity class="NE" id=5539>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> , who convinced Aerys the <entity class="NE" id=5540>Lannisters</entity> were there to help . Aerys opened the city gates , and the <entity class="NE" id=5541>Lannisters</entity> proceeded to sack the city . Jaime again begged Aerys to surrender , but the <entity class="NE" id=5542>Mad King</entity> ordered <entity class="NE" id=5543>Jaime</entity> to bring him <entity class="NE" id=5544>Tywin</entity> 's head , and his pyromancer to set the city ablaze , burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with wildfire . <entity class="NE" id=5545>Jaime</entity> makes it plain to <entity class="NE" id=5546>Brienne</entity> that was his breaking point and asks her what she would do if her precious Renly commanded her to kill her own father and then stand by and do nothing as he murdered thousands of innocent people ; she can only sit in shocked silence . <entity class="NE" id=5547>Jaime</entity> goes on to say that he killed the pyromancer first , then drove his sword into <entity class="NE" id=5548>Aerys</entity> 's back as the <entity class="NE" id=5549>Mad King</entity> tried to run for his life . Shaken at the memory , <entity class="NE" id=5550>Jaime</entity> speculates that King <entity class="NE" id=5551>Aerys</entity> did n't believe he would die in the blaze ; in his lunacy , the <entity class="NE" id=5552>Mad King</entity> believed he would be reborn as a dragon in the fire , granting him the power to burn his enemies to ashes . so <entity class="NE" id=5553>Jaime</entity> finished <entity class="NE" id=5554>Aerys</entity> off by slitting his throat in order to make sure he died , concluding that <entity class="NE" id=5555>Eddard Stark</entity> found him at that point . Stunned , <entity class="NE" id=5556>Brienne</entity> asks why <entity class="NE" id=5557>Jaime</entity> did n't defend himself with this account before . Jaime angrily rants that the `` honorable '' <entity class="NE" id=5558>Lord Stark</entity> would never have believed a word he said : <entity class="NE" id=5559>Stark</entity> did n't want to hear <entity class="NE" id=5560>Jaime</entity> 's side of the story when he 'd already judged him guilty . Jaime faints . <entity class="NE" id=5561>Jaime</entity> goes on to rage , yelling what right <entity class="NE" id=5562>Stark</entity> had to judge him , by what right the wolf dares to judge the lion . The strain of recounting his harrowing tale overcomes Jaime , however , and he begins to faint , nearly falling face-first into the water . <entity class="NE" id=5563>Brienne</entity> catches him and calls for help for the <entity class="NE" id=5564>Kingslayer</entity> , at which ( as he slips out of consciousness ) he whimpers to himself `` Jaime . My name is Jaime . `` . The <entity class="NE" id=5565>Hound</entity> vs <entity class="NE" id=5566>Beric</entity> . Elsewhere in the <entity class="NE" id=5567>Riverlands</entity> , at the hideout of the <entity class="NE" id=5568>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> in <entity class="NE" id=5569>Hollow Hill</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5570>Sandor Clegane</entity> prepares to fight <entity class="NE" id=5571>Beric Dondarrion</entity> in a trial by combat . As both men prepare , <entity class="NE" id=5572>Thoros</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5573>Myr</entity> prays to the <entity class="NE" id=5574>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5575>Light</entity> to judge <entity class="NE" id=5576>Sandor</entity> for his crimes if he is guilty or give strength to his sword if he is innocent . Before the fight begins , <entity class="NE" id=5577>Beric</entity> calls upon the <entity class="NE" id=5578>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5579>Light</entity> to ignite his sword with flame , using only his blood . Due to the <entity class="NE" id=5580>Sandor</entity> 's fear of fire , <entity class="NE" id=5581>Beric</entity> initially has an advantage against the <entity class="NE" id=5582>Hound</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5583>Beric</entity> even manages to set <entity class="NE" id=5584>Sandor</entity> 's wooden shield on fire , which is strapped so tightly to <entity class="NE" id=5584>Sandor</entity> 's arm that he can not remove it and is nearly burned himself . Eventually , however , <entity class="NE" id=5585>Sandor</entity> 's raw physical strength and anger ( born of terror ) overpowers <entity class="NE" id=5586>Beric</entity> , and with a single downward swipe , cuts right through his flaming sword , his armor , and deep into his shoulder , killing him . <entity class="NE" id=5587>Thoros</entity> reviving <entity class="NE" id=5588>Beric</entity> . As <entity class="NE" id=5589>Beric</entity> falls to the ground , <entity class="NE" id=5590>Thoros</entity> quickly rushes to his side , and begins praying to the <entity class="NE" id=5591>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5592>Light</entity> to revive him . <entity class="NE" id=5593>Sandor</entity> falls to the ground to desperately try and extinguish his flaming shield . <entity class="NE" id=5594>Arya Arya</entity> grabs a dagger and attempts to kill the <entity class="NE" id=5595>Hound</entity> while he is down , but she is stopped by <entity class="NE" id=5596>Gendry</entity> . As she curses him , <entity class="NE" id=5597>Sandor</entity> taunts <entity class="NE" id=5598>Arya</entity> over how the god prefers him over her dead friend , however they are both interrupted by <entity class="NE" id=5599>Beric</entity> , who has been revived by the <entity class="NE" id=5600>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5601>Light</entity> 's power . Having won the trial , and proven his innocence in the eyes of god , <entity class="NE" id=5602>Sandor</entity> is allowed to leave . The <entity class="NE" id=5603>Brotherhood</entity> had taken all of the gold <entity class="NE" id=5604>Sandor</entity> had on him ( to fund their cause ) , and in lieu of returning it , <entity class="NE" id=5605>Beric</entity> gives him a promissory note which will grant payment at the end of the war . <entity class="NE" id=5606>Sandor</entity> scoffs at this and throws it to the ground , but <entity class="NE" id=5607>Anguy</entity> says he should be thankful they 're letting him leave with his life . <entity class="NE" id=5608>Clegane</entity> is hooded so he wo n't know the way back to their hideout , then led away to be released some distance away . After the fight , <entity class="NE" id=5609>Gendry</entity> works on repairing <entity class="NE" id=5610>Beric</entity> 's armor , and <entity class="NE" id=5611>Arya</entity> questions why , because they will be leaving soon . <entity class="NE" id=5612>Gendry</entity> says that he has decided to stay and work as a smith for the <entity class="NE" id=5613>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> , to aid them in their cause to protect the smallfolk during the war . <entity class="NE" id=5614>Arya</entity> says that their plan was to find her brother <entity class="NE" id=5615>Robb</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=5615>Robb</entity> needs soldiers too , but <entity class="NE" id=5616>Gendry</entity> points out that he has no attachments to <entity class="NE" id=5617>Robb Stark</entity> : <entity class="NE" id=5614>Arya</entity> would be going to her noble-born family , and he 'd just be serving another lord . <entity class="NE" id=5618>Gendry</entity> says he 's been serving other men his whole life and he has nothing to show for it : he worked most of his life for <entity class="NE" id=5619>Tobho Mott</entity> and he repaid Gendry by selling him to the <entity class="NE" id=5620>Night's Watch</entity> ( as soon as the secret payments from <entity class="NE" id=5621>Varys</entity> ended ) , and he `` served '' <entity class="NE" id=5622>Tywin Lannister</entity> as a prisoner at <entity class="NE" id=5623>Harrenhal</entity> , every day afraid he 'd be killed or tortured . He 'd be serving in the <entity class="NE" id=5624>Brotherhood</entity> too , but they chose <entity class="NE" id=5625>Beric</entity> as their leader , and they 're more like a family - and as a common-born tavern maiden 's son who was orphaned at a young age , <entity class="NE" id=5626>Gendry</entity> has never had a family . <entity class="NE" id=5627>Arya</entity> sadly chokes out that she could be his family . In response , <entity class="NE" id=5628>Gendry</entity> politely but firmly points out that the class differences between them mean that if he goes back with her , they 'd never be family : he 'd still be a commoner , and she 'd be `` m'lady . `` . Later that night , <entity class="NE" id=5629>Arya</entity> looks into the campfire and recites her nightly prayer-list for the death of her enemies . <entity class="NE" id=5630>Thoros</entity> says that they plan to bring her to Riverrun to reunite her with her family , and in exchange for a reward from <entity class="NE" id=5631>Robb</entity> to fund their cause . <entity class="NE" id=5632>Arya</entity> points out that they are ransoming her , and <entity class="NE" id=5633>Thoros</entity> admits they technically are , but this is different . They do intend to escort her safely through the war-ravaged countryside to her family , and <entity class="NE" id=5634>Beric</entity> would like to return her for free out of memory of her father , but they really need the gold to support themselves . <entity class="NE" id=5635>Beric</entity> says he knows she must be angry with him , but releasing <entity class="NE" id=5636>Sandor</entity> was the right thing to do , as they 'd promised to let him go free if he won the trial by combat . <entity class="NE" id=5637>Arya</entity> is still quietly upset , as she 's now seen many honorable men keep their promises and behave lawfully only to be killed for it ( such as <entity class="NE" id=5638>Yoren</entity> and her own father ) . She wonders why <entity class="NE" id=5639>Beric</entity> would want to let <entity class="NE" id=5640>Sandor</entity> go when he nearly killed him , but <entity class="NE" id=5639>Beric</entity> insists that he did actually kill him . When <entity class="NE" id=5641>Arya</entity> asks how , <entity class="NE" id=5642>Beric</entity> points her to Thoros to explain , but he says that he is n't the one who brings <entity class="NE" id=5642>Beric</entity> back to life , it 's the <entity class="NE" id=5643>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5644>Light</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=5645>Thoros</entity> is just the `` lucky drunk '' who recites the prayers . <entity class="NE" id=5646>Beric</entity> opens his shirt to reveal several grievous scars on his torso : they explain that <entity class="NE" id=5646>Beric</entity> has actually died and then been brought back to life six times now , counting his recent death in the trial by combat . He has been impaled on a lance , shot with an arrow , and at his fifth death the <entity class="NE" id=5647>Lannisters</entity> hanged him for treason and stuck a dagger in his eye ( which did n't heal when <entity class="NE" id=5648>Thoros</entity> brought him back ) . <entity class="NE" id=5649>Arya</entity> earnestly asks <entity class="NE" id=5650>Thoros</entity> if he could bring back to life a man without a head . Thoros and <entity class="NE" id=5651>Beric</entity> both understand that she is asking about bringing back her father , but <entity class="NE" id=5652>Thoros</entity> says he does n't think it works that way ( both because he was decapitated , and because he 's been dead for far too long by now ) . <entity class="NE" id=5653>Beric</entity> consoles her that her father was a good man , but he would n't wish his resurrected life on him . <entity class="NE" id=5654>Beric</entity> explains that being brought back from the dead carries a heavy toll , as pieces of his memory and who he was before chip away each time . <entity class="NE" id=5655>Arya</entity> still says she would wish <entity class="NE" id=5656>Beric</entity> 's life on her father , because at least <entity class="NE" id=5656>Beric</entity> is still alive . At <entity class="NE" id=5657>Dragonstone</entity> , King <entity class="NE" id=5658>Stannis Baratheon</entity> is still deeply depressed after his defeat at the <entity class="NE" id=5659>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=5660>Blackwater</entity> , and does n't have the daily support of the <entity class="NE" id=5661>Red Priestess Melisandre</entity> since she left on what she claimed was an important mission . Most of <entity class="NE" id=5662>Stannis</entity> ' army has been destroyed , and the only reason the Lannisters have n't attacked <entity class="NE" id=5663>Dragonstone</entity> yet is because so much of their fleet was destroyed at <entity class="NE" id=5664>Blackwater</entity> that they can not yet mount an amphibious assault . With little else to do , <entity class="NE" id=5665>Stannis</entity> takes the time to visit his wife , <entity class="NE" id=5666>Queen Selyse</entity> ( who was born into <entity class="HSE" id=5667>House Florent</entity> ) , for the first time since returning from the battle . He finds her in her chamber , praying over a fire to the <entity class="NE" id=5668>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5669>Light</entity> : <entity class="NE" id=5670>Selyse</entity> is a fanatical believer in the <entity class="NE" id=5668>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5669>Light</entity> religion , far more so than <entity class="NE" id=5671>Stannis</entity> , and it was indeed Selyse who first invited <entity class="NE" id=5672>Melisandre</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=5673>Dragonstone</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5674>Stannis</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5675>Selyse</entity> do not have a loving relationship , but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the <entity class="NE" id=5676>Lord</entity> 's Chosen . She tells him not to despair despite his defeat , and he will be victorious , but he laments that he used to believe that once . Due to his extreme belief in duty , ( unlike his hedonistic brother <entity class="NE" id=5677>Robert</entity> ) <entity class="NE" id=5678>Stannis</entity> is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to <entity class="NE" id=5679>Selyse</entity> , when he had sex with <entity class="NE" id=5680>Melisandre</entity> to create the Shadow-assassin creature that killed Renly . He begins to confess to Selyse that he has sinned and shamed her , but she interrupts him and says <entity class="NE" id=5681>Melisandre</entity> already told her everything - and that no act done in service of the <entity class="NE" id=5682>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5683>Light</entity> can be a sin . Indeed , she wept for joy when <entity class="NE" id=5684>Melisandre</entity> told her of this service she did for the <entity class="NE" id=5685>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5686>Light</entity> with <entity class="NE" id=5687>Stannis</entity> , and because the <entity class="NE" id=5688>Red Priestess</entity> gave him a `` son '' ( of sorts ) which she never could . <entity class="NE" id=5689>Stannis</entity> ' face is filled with a mix of shock , disgust , and relief . <entity class="NE" id=5690>Selyse</entity> had three sons with <entity class="NE" id=5691>Stannis</entity> but they were all stillborn , and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars . The deaths of her `` sweet boys '' and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected <entity class="NE" id=5692>Selyse</entity> , and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the <entity class="NE" id=5693>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5694>Light</entity> . She weeps , and laments that she has given <entity class="NE" id=5695>Stannis</entity> nothing - he does not blame her , and with pity he says that 's not true . <entity class="NE" id=5696>Selyse</entity> understands he is referring to their daughter and only child , <entity class="NE" id=5697>Princess Shireen Baratheon</entity> . She grows annoyed when she realizes he 's come to see her too , and says he should n't waste time on such distractions , but insists that she is his daughter , and she relents because it is not her place to question her king . <entity class="NE" id=5698>Shireen</entity> visits <entity class="NE" id=5699>Davos</entity> while in the dungeons . <entity class="NE" id=5700>Shireen</entity> is alone in her room drawing and singing a song about life under the sea to herself , and is excited to see her father . She is a cheerful but sickly young girl ( about the same age as <entity class="NE" id=5701>Arya Stark</entity> ) , with the left side of her face badly scarred and disfigured by the dreaded <entity class="NE" id=5702>Greyscale</entity> disease . <entity class="NE" id=5703>Stannis</entity> wanted to see his daughter , but he is awkward in expressing warm emotions to her . She says she heard he was in a battle and asks if he won , and he good-naturedly says no . <entity class="NE" id=5704>Shireen</entity> is slightly let-down , but asks if the <entity class="NE" id=5705>Onion Knight</entity> came back as well : <entity class="NE" id=5706>Ser Davos Seaworth</entity> has been her friend during his service to her father , and he even made her a toy ship . Growing tense over their falling out , <entity class="NE" id=5707>Stannis</entity> briefly explains that <entity class="NE" id=5708>Ser Davos</entity> is a traitor and is rotting in the dungeon . Confused , he flatly says she should best put him out of her mind . Later that night , <entity class="NE" id=5709>Shireen</entity> sneaks down to the dungeon of <entity class="NE" id=5710>Dragonstone</entity> and finds the cell of `` <entity class="NE" id=5711>Ser Onion Knight</entity> . '' He wakes up and tells her she should n't be there , but she explains that the fat guard <entity class="NE" id=5712>Bert</entity> is on duty , who usually drinks a lot of wine and sleeps through his watch . She asks if it is true that he is a traitor , and he says that it is , as he disobeyed her father . She says she does n't care , he 's her friend . She was worried that he must get bored down in his cell , so she brought him a book to read , about Aegon the <entity class="NE" id=5713>Conquer</entity> and his dragons - she excitedly points out that the <entity class="NE" id=5714>Targaryens</entity> built <entity class="NE" id=5715>Dragonstone</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=5716>Aegon</entity> used to live in this very castle . <entity class="NE" id=5717>Davos</entity> reluctantly explains that it 's wasted on him , because he does n't know how to read . Undaunted , <entity class="NE" id=5718>Shireen</entity> offers to teach him how to read , by coming down to his cell and reading to him when <entity class="NE" id=5719>Bert</entity> is on duty . <entity class="NE" id=5720>Davos</entity> chides her that they ca n't , but she asks what 's the worst the guards could do to them if they find out , lock them in cells ? They have a quiet laugh , and <entity class="NE" id=5721>Shireen</entity> starts to read to Davos An History of Aegon the <entity class="NE" id=5722>Conqueror</entity> and His <entity class="NE" id=5723>Conquest</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5724>Westeros</entity> . In <entity class="NE" id=5725>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=5726>Queen Regent Cersei Lannister</entity> encounters <entity class="NE" id=5727>Petyr</entity> `` Littlefinger '' <entity class="NE" id=5728>Baelish</entity> in a courtyard , and tells him she fears that the <entity class="NE" id=5729>Tyrells</entity> do not have the <entity class="NE" id=5730>Lannisters</entity> ' best interests at heart , but her father wo n't listen . Therefore , she asks that <entity class="NE" id=5731>Littlefinger</entity> use his spies to try to find out what they 're up to , because he has a good working relationship with them after brokering the Lannister-Tyrell alliance . He agrees , but <entity class="NE" id=5732>Cersei</entity> warns him that this had better produce more results than when she previously asked him to find <entity class="NE" id=5733>Arya Stark</entity> , but the girl could not be found . In the castle gardens , <entity class="NE" id=5734>Sansa Stark</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5735>Margaery Tyrell</entity> watch her brother <entity class="NE" id=5736>Ser Loras</entity> spar with his squire . <entity class="NE" id=5737>Sansa</entity> confidently remarks on his fighting ability , and inquires when she and <entity class="NE" id=5738>Loras</entity> will wed , as per the <entity class="NE" id=5739>Tyrell</entity> plot to keep her out of the hands of <entity class="NE" id=5740>Baelish</entity> and/or the <entity class="NE" id=5741>Lannisters</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5742>Margaery</entity> replies that she will `` plant the seed '' of the idea after she and <entity class="NE" id=5743>Joffrey</entity> are married . <entity class="NE" id=5744>Sansa</entity> is skeptical <entity class="NE" id=5745>Joffrey</entity> will let her go but <entity class="NE" id=5746>Margaery</entity> is confident he will do it to please her , once she is his wife . After the match , <entity class="NE" id=5747>Ser Loras</entity> ' new squire Olyvar flirts with him , which leads to them having sex back in <entity class="NE" id=5748>Loras</entity> ' chambers . As they finish , <entity class="NE" id=5749>Loras</entity> mentions that he is engaged to be married . a fact that <entity class="NE" id=5750>Olyvar</entity> passes on to his real master , <entity class="NE" id=5751>Littlefinger</entity> , so he can pass the information on to <entity class="NE" id=5752>Cersei</entity> . Loras and <entity class="NE" id=5753>Olyvar</entity> . A short time later , <entity class="NE" id=5754>Littlefinger</entity> meets with <entity class="NE" id=5755>Sansa</entity> , offering her a place on his ship that will take him from the capital to the <entity class="NE" id=5756>Vale</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=5757>Arryn</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=5758>Sansa</entity> practices lying for a change , and tells him that they should wait until after <entity class="NE" id=5759>Joffrey</entity> 's wedding , primarily because she fears for his safety if the plan fails . A master manipulator , <entity class="NE" id=5760>Littlefinger</entity> is clearly suspicious of her motives , but does n't press the matter for the moment . Instead he says he is touched by her concern for his safety , and insists that she call him `` Petyr . `` . At the same time , <entity class="NE" id=5761>Tyrion Lannister</entity> is engaged in a meeting with <entity class="NE" id=5762>Lady Olenna Tyrell</entity> ; with the upcoming royal wedding shaping up to be an extravagant and expensive affair , <entity class="NE" id=5763>Tyrion</entity> is concerned about the cost . <entity class="NE" id=5764>Olenna</entity> points out that the <entity class="NE" id=5765>Tyrells</entity> have done much to supply the city with soldiers and provisions to assist in the war effort , as well as the coming winter . <entity class="NE" id=5766>Olenna</entity> is bored to discuss financial matters , but quickly lists off specific details of the soldiers and supplies the Tyrells are supplying to aid the crown , demonstrating that <entity class="NE" id=5767>Tyrion</entity> does n't need to lecture her about wartime expenses . She insists that the royal wedding must go on as planned , as it will do much to improve the city 's morale and keep the people happy , otherwise they will start blaming the <entity class="NE" id=5768>Lannisters</entity> for the war again . <entity class="NE" id=5769>Tyrion</entity> can not outmaneuver <entity class="NE" id=5770>Olenna</entity> , but in the end she decides on her own that she wo n't have it said <entity class="HSE" id=5771>House Tyrell</entity> is n't doing its part to help , so she agrees to pay for half the cost of the festivities , for which <entity class="NE" id=5769>Tyrion</entity> is grateful . <entity class="NE" id=5772>Tyrion</entity> heads to the <entity class="NE" id=5773>Small Council</entity> chamber to report success to his father <entity class="NE" id=5774>Tywin</entity> , only to find <entity class="NE" id=5775>Cersei</entity> present as well , much to his annoyance . <entity class="NE" id=5776>Tywin</entity> explains that the Tyrells are plotting to wed <entity class="NE" id=5777>Sansa</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=5778>Ser Loras</entity> and states that he will not allow them to steal `` the key to the north '' out from under him . <entity class="NE" id=5779>Tyrion</entity> questions how <entity class="NE" id=5780>Sansa</entity> is the key to the <entity class="NE" id=5781>North</entity> , given that her older brother is still alive . <entity class="NE" id=5782>Tywin</entity> explains that the desertion of the <entity class="NE" id=5783>Karstarks</entity> have cost <entity class="NE" id=5784>Robb Stark</entity> half his army , and ( combined with already being badly outnumbered by the Lannister-Tyrell alliance ) his days are now numbered . Theon <entity class="NE" id=5785>Greyjoy</entity> murdered <entity class="NE" id=5786>Robb</entity> 's younger brothers at <entity class="NE" id=5787>Winterfell</entity> , which makes <entity class="NE" id=5788>Sansa Robb</entity> 's heir : if he dies , rule of <entity class="NE" id=5787>Winterfell</entity> and the <entity class="NE" id=5789>North</entity> goes to her and any man she marries . which <entity class="NE" id=5790>Tywin</entity> has no intention of letting the <entity class="NE" id=5791>Tyrells</entity> get their hands on . <entity class="NE" id=5792>Tyrion</entity> questions if it is wise to offend their allies by refusing the match , but <entity class="NE" id=5793>Tywin</entity> points out that as a plot against them , the <entity class="NE" id=5794>Tyrells</entity> ' plan is , by definition , a secret , thus the <entity class="NE" id=5795>Lannisters</entity> ca n't be said to be `` refusing '' them something which they are n't officially trying to do . He also notes that the <entity class="NE" id=5796>Tyrells</entity> wo n't go through with their plan until after <entity class="NE" id=5797>Joffrey</entity> 's wedding , which means they need to act first . namely by finding <entity class="NE" id=5798>Sansa</entity> another husband . After a moment , <entity class="NE" id=5799>Tyrion</entity> realizes from the comments of his father and sister that they are talking about him . <entity class="NE" id=5800>Tyrion</entity> tries to protest , pointing out that <entity class="NE" id=5801>Joffrey</entity> has made <entity class="NE" id=5802>Sansa</entity> 's life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force <entity class="NE" id=5800>Tyrion</entity> on her after she has finally escaped <entity class="NE" id=5801>Joffrey</entity> is cruel , even by <entity class="NE" id=5803>Tywin</entity> 's standards . <entity class="NE" id=5804>Tywin</entity> questions if <entity class="NE" id=5805>Tyrion</entity> plans to mistreat <entity class="NE" id=5806>Sansa</entity> and asserts that he is not concerned with the girl 's happiness and neither should his son . <entity class="NE" id=5807>Tyrion</entity> protests that <entity class="NE" id=5808>Sansa</entity> is a child , but <entity class="NE" id=5809>Cersei</entity> counters she has flowered and is a woman now who can bear children . <entity class="NE" id=5810>Tyrion</entity> flatly refuses , but <entity class="NE" id=5811>Tywin</entity> points out that recently he was complaining that he was n't rewarded for his actions in the <entity class="NE" id=5812>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=5813>Blackwater</entity> , and as heiress to the <entity class="NE" id=5814>North</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=5815>Sansa</entity> is a far better reward than he could expect , and in any case , it is long past time <entity class="NE" id=5810>Tyrion</entity> was wed. At this , <entity class="NE" id=5810>Tyrion</entity> snarls that he was wed , referring to his past marriage to <entity class="NE" id=5816>Tysha</entity> , asking if his father has forgotten that . Returning his son 's hateful glare with one of his own , <entity class="NE" id=5817>Tywin</entity> retorts that he remembers all too well . <entity class="NE" id=5818>Tywin</entity> arranges some marriages . <entity class="NE" id=5819>Cersei</entity> gloats over the matter , but her smug attitude quickly evaporates when her father commands that she will wed <entity class="NE" id=5820>Ser Loras</entity> instead . <entity class="NE" id=5821>Cersei</entity> flatly refuses , but <entity class="NE" id=5822>Tywin</entity> is insistent : the marriages of <entity class="NE" id=5821>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=5823>Tyrion</entity> will place the <entity class="NE" id=5824>North</entity> and the Reach firmly in the <entity class="NE" id=5825>Lannisters</entity> ' control . <entity class="NE" id=5826>Tywin</entity> points out that <entity class="NE" id=5827>Cersei</entity> is still fertile : she needs to marry and `` breed . '' When <entity class="NE" id=5828>Cersei</entity> protests she is <entity class="NE" id=5829>Queen Regent</entity> and not a brood mare , <entity class="NE" id=5830>Tywin</entity> angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told : she will marry <entity class="NE" id=5831>Loras</entity> and in so doing , put an end to what <entity class="NE" id=5830>Tywin</entity> calls `` the disgusting rumors '' <entity class="NE" id=5832>Stannis</entity> has been spreading about her and Jaime . <entity class="NE" id=5833>Cersei</entity> switches to earnestly begging him , calling him `` father '' and pleading that he not force her into an arranged marriage a second time ( after her long and loveless marriage with King <entity class="NE" id=5834>Robert</entity> ) . <entity class="NE" id=5835>Tywin</entity> refuses to listen and storms out in disgust , raging that the pair have disgraced the <entity class="NE" id=5836>Lannister</entity> name for far too long . <entity class="NE" id=5837>Cersei</entity> slowly shifts her gaze toward <entity class="NE" id=5838>Tyrion</entity> to gauge his reaction to her distress but sees he is too glum about his own predicament .
