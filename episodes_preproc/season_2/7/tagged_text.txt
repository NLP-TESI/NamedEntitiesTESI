<entity id=3246>Jaime</entity> meets a relative ; Theon hunts ; <entity id=3247>Dany</entity> receives an invitation . In the <entity id=3248>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . At <entity id=3249>Winterfell</entity> , now held by the ironborn , <entity id=3250>Theon Greyjoy</entity> awakens to find that Osha is gone and she has escaped with <entity id=3251>Hodor</entity> , <entity id=3252>Bran Stark</entity> , <entity id=3253>Rickon Stark</entity> and their direwolves . <entity id=3254>Theon</entity> berates <entity id=3255>Lorren</entity> for allowing them to escape . When <entity id=3256>Lorren</entity> counters that Theon is also to blame for sleeping with <entity id=3257>Osha</entity> and letting his guard down , Theon furiously beats him . Theon leads the ironborn on horse to hunt down the boys with hounds to track them . The search leads them to a shepherd 's farm , but the farmer says that he has n't seen anyone . <entity id=3258>Dagmer</entity> finds some walnut shells , so they know that <entity id=3259>Bran</entity> and <entity id=3260>Rickon</entity> were there , but the hounds ca n't get the scent . <entity id=3261>Theon</entity> tells them the hunt is over and to return <entity id=3262>Maester Luwin</entity> to Winterfell : he knows where they are , and his mercy has been exhausted . <entity id=3263>Theon</entity> has the burned bodies raised on the walls of <entity id=3264>Winterfell</entity> . Theon returns to Winterfell with two children 's bodies burned beyond recognition , and he has them hoisted to either side of the main gate . <entity id=3265>Maester Maester</entity> cries out in grief when he sees them . At <entity id=3266>Harrenhal</entity> , <entity id=3267>Tywin Lannister</entity> is discussing the assassination of <entity id=3268>Amory Lorch</entity> with <entity id=3269>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> . <entity id=3270>Tywin</entity> is convinced that it was an assassination attempt on himself , unaware that <entity id=3271>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> actually killed <entity id=3272>Lorch</entity> on the request of <entity id=3273>Arya Stark</entity> . <entity id=3274>Ser Ser</entity> speculates that the <entity id=3275>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> may have been responsible . <entity id=3276>Enraged</entity> , <entity id=3277>Tywin</entity> orders <entity id=3278>Gregor</entity> to burn out villages and farms in reprisal for this assassination attempt . <entity id=3279>Tywin</entity> later suspects that <entity id=3280>Arya</entity> is highborn , because she does n't pronounce `` M'Lord '' the way commoners do , instead saying `` My Lord , '' and possesses an educated vocabulary . <entity id=3281>Arya</entity> makes the excuse that her Mother , whom she said was a handmaiden for years to royalty , had taught her to speak properly like them . In <entity id=3282>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity id=3283>Sansa Stark</entity> comes to thank <entity id=3284>Sandor</entity> `` The <entity id=3285>Hound</entity> '' <entity id=3286>Clegane</entity> for saving her life during the recent riot in the city and says that he was very brave . <entity id=3287>Sandor</entity> simply says that a dog does n't need courage to fight off rats . <entity id=3288>Sansa</entity> is perturbed by his `` hateful speech , '' but <entity id=3289>Sandor</entity> cautions that a day will come when his penchant for violence is all that stands between her and her `` beloved '' King Joffrey . <entity id=3290>Sansa</entity> and <entity id=3291>Shae</entity> trying to flip the mattress . <entity id=3292>Sansa</entity> awakens in her bed from a nightmare , only to find the sheets covered in blood–she has begun menstruating for the first time . Given that <entity id=3293>Joffrey</entity> openly promised to rape <entity id=3294>Sansa</entity> to `` put a son in you '' as soon as she had her blood , she then frantically tries to get rid of the bloody sheets to remove the evidence . <entity id=3295>Shae</entity> tries to help <entity id=3296>Sansa</entity> hide the sheets but <entity id=3297>Sandor</entity> finds them . Terrified of being brought to <entity id=3298>Joffrey</entity> , <entity id=3299>Sansa</entity> is instead brought before <entity id=3300>Queen Regent Cersei Lannister</entity> , who awkwardly tries to comfort her . <entity id=3301>Cersei</entity> presents <entity id=3302>Sansa</entity> with warped advice on <entity id=3303>Joffrey</entity> , bizarre counseling based on her bitter marriage with King <entity id=3304>Robert Baratheon</entity> . Blithely waving away her son 's torment of <entity id=3305>Sansa</entity> and homicidal outbursts she says that her brother <entity id=3306>Jaime Lannister</entity> stayed by her side the whole time she was giving birth to <entity id=3307>Joffrey</entity> , but <entity id=3305>Sansa</entity> should never expect such devotion from <entity id=3307>Joffrey</entity> . <entity id=3308>Cersei</entity> firmly believes that <entity id=3309>Sansa</entity> and <entity id=3310>Joffrey</entity> not being in love is a good thing ; she advises <entity id=3309>Sansa</entity> `` the more people you love , the weaker you are . '' <entity id=3311>Cersei</entity> says that no one expects her to love <entity id=3312>Joffrey</entity> , though she may take comfort in her love for the children they will have . Privately , <entity id=3313>Cersei</entity> meets with <entity id=3314>Tyrion</entity> and expresses regret at having children with her own brother Jaime . She wonders if <entity id=3315>Joffrey</entity> 's violent personality is the price of her and <entity id=3316>Jaime</entity> 's sins . <entity id=3317>Tyrion</entity> earnestly points out that her other two children , <entity id=3318>Myrcella</entity> and <entity id=3319>Tommen</entity> , are not monsters , and they share an odd moment of sympathy . <entity id=3320>Torrhen Torrhen</entity> discovers the body of <entity id=3321>Alton Lannister</entity> . At <entity id=3322>King Robb Stark</entity> 's army camp in the <entity id=3323>Westerlands</entity> , close to an unidentified keep , <entity id=3324>Alton Lannister</entity> returns as an envoy giving <entity id=3325>Queen Cersei</entity> 's response to <entity id=3326>Robb</entity> 's peace terms . <entity id=3327>Robb</entity> is unsurprised that she rejected them and imprisons <entity id=3328>Alton</entity> with his cousin <entity id=3329>Jaime Lannister</entity> . The nurse <entity id=3330>Talisa Maegyr</entity> discusses medical supplies she needs with <entity id=3331>Robb</entity> . <entity id=3332>Robb</entity> suggests she accompany him to the <entity id=3333>Crag</entity> to acquire the supplies she needs . That night , <entity id=3334>Jaime</entity> kills <entity id=3335>Alton</entity> to lure the guard , <entity id=3336>Torrhen Karstark</entity> , into his cell . <entity id=3337>Jaime</entity> strangles <entity id=3338>Torrhen</entity> and escapes , but is soon recaptured . <entity id=3339>Torrhen</entity> was the son of <entity id=3340>Lord Rickard Karstark</entity> , one of the major nobles from the <entity id=3341>North</entity> . <entity id=3342>Lord Lord</entity> demands <entity id=3343>Jaime</entity> 's execution in revenge , regardless of his protected status as both a prisoner of war and a valuable political hostage . <entity id=3344>Catelyn</entity> is forced to argue for <entity id=3345>Jaime</entity> 's life . <entity id=3346>Catelyn</entity> confronts Jaime and tells him that he has no honor . Jaime bitterly explains that his vows as a knight required him to defend the innocent and serve the king , but his king was slaughtering the innocent . <entity id=3347>Jaime</entity> considers concepts like `` honor '' and `` loyalty '' naïve at best and hypocritical at worst . <entity id=3348>Jaime</entity> asserts that he has only been with <entity id=3349>Cersei</entity> and begins to ridicule <entity id=3350>Eddard Stark</entity> , <entity id=3351>Catelyn</entity> 's late husband , by bringing up the shame of <entity id=3352>Eddard</entity> fathering a bastard . This brings <entity id=3353>Catelyn</entity> to breaking point and she asks for <entity id=3354>Brienne</entity> 's sword . Beyond the <entity id=3355>Wall</entity> . <entity id=3356>Jon Jon</entity> is still separated from the <entity id=3357>Night</entity> 's Watch scouting group led by <entity id=3358>Qhorin Halfhand</entity> . He attempts to locate them , traveling with his wildling prisoner <entity id=3359>Ygritte</entity> . She argues with <entity id=3360>Jon</entity> , criticizing him for ignoring their common descent from the <entity id=3361>First Men</entity> . She states that the animosity of the southerners to the <entity id=3362>Wildlings</entity> is arbitrary , given that the Wildlings are only distinguished from them by living north of the Wall when it was constructed . She mocks <entity id=3363>Jon</entity> 's sexual repression and surmises that he is a virgin . She taunts him by offering to teach him how to have sex . She escapes and leads him into an ambush . <entity id=3364>Ygritte</entity> says that <entity id=3365>Jon</entity> should have taken her when he had the chance . In <entity id=3366>Qarth</entity> . <entity id=3367>Daenerys Daenerys</entity> is desperate to find her stolen dragons . <entity id=3368>Ser Ser</entity> returns and she orders him to find them . <entity id=3369>Xaro Xaro</entity> claims to be distressed at breaking his promise to protect her , fearing that his word will be publicly seen as worthless . <entity id=3370>Jorah</entity> questions Quaithe of <entity id=3371>Asshai</entity> . <entity id=3372>Quaithe</entity> knows that <entity id=3373>Jorah</entity> once betrayed <entity id=3374>Daenerys</entity> by spying on her . <entity id=3375>Quaithe</entity> warns <entity id=3376>Jorah</entity> that the man who stole the dragons is already with <entity id=3377>Daenerys</entity> . <entity id=3378>Jorah</entity> finds <entity id=3379>Daenerys</entity> , in the company of <entity id=3380>Kovarro</entity> , pleading with the council of The Thirteen to find her dragons . The warlock <entity id=3381>Pyat Pree</entity> confesses to stealing the dragons and declares Xaro the King of <entity id=3382>Qarth</entity> . Doubles of the warlock then magically appear behind the other members of the <entity id=3383>Thirteen</entity> and slit their throats , leaving only <entity id=3384>Pyat Pree</entity> and <entity id=3385>Xaro</entity> . <entity id=3386>Xaro</entity> secretly entered into an alliance with <entity id=3387>Pyat Pree</entity> to become king . <entity id=3388>Pyat Pree</entity> urges <entity id=3389>Daenerys</entity> to find her dragons at the House of the Undying as the three flee .
