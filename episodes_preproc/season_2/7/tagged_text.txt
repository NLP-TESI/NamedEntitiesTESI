In the <entity class="NE" id=3227>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=3228>Winterfell</entity> , now held by the ironborn , <entity class="NE" id=3229>Theon Greyjoy</entity> awakens to find that Osha is gone and she has escaped with <entity class="NE" id=3230>Hodor</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3231>Bran Stark</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3232>Rickon Stark</entity> and their direwolves . <entity class="NE" id=3233>Theon</entity> berates <entity class="NE" id=3234>Lorren</entity> for allowing them to escape . When <entity class="NE" id=3234>Lorren</entity> counters that Theon is also to blame for sleeping with <entity class="NE" id=3236>Osha</entity> and letting his guard down , Theon furiously beats him . Theon leads the ironborn on horse to hunt down the boys with hounds to track them . The search leads them to a shepherd 's farm , but the farmer says that he has n't seen anyone . <entity class="NE" id=3237>Dagmer</entity> finds some walnut shells , so they know that <entity class="NE" id=3238>Bran</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3239>Rickon</entity> were there , but the hounds ca n't get the scent . <entity class="NE" id=3233>Theon</entity> tells them the hunt is over and to return <entity class="NE" id=3241>Maester Luwin</entity> to Winterfell : he knows where they are , and his mercy has been exhausted . <entity class="NE" id=3233>Theon</entity> has the burned bodies raised on the walls of <entity class="NE" id=3228>Winterfell</entity> . Theon returns to Winterfell with two children 's bodies burned beyond recognition , and he has them hoisted to either side of the main gate . <entity class="NE" id=3244>Maester Maester</entity> cries out in grief when he sees them . At <entity class="NE" id=3245>Harrenhal</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3246>Tywin Lannister</entity> is discussing the assassination of <entity class="NE" id=3247>Amory Lorch</entity> with <entity class="NE" id=3248>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3249>Tywin</entity> is convinced that it was an assassination attempt on himself , unaware that <entity class="NE" id=3250>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> actually killed <entity class="NE" id=3251>Lorch</entity> on the request of <entity class="NE" id=3252>Arya Stark</entity> . Ser Ser speculates that the <entity class="NE" id=3253>Brotherhood Without Banners</entity> may have been responsible . <entity class="NE" id=3254>Enraged</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3249>Tywin</entity> orders <entity class="NE" id=3256>Gregor</entity> to burn out villages and farms in reprisal for this assassination attempt . <entity class="NE" id=3249>Tywin</entity> later suspects that <entity class="NE" id=3258>Arya</entity> is highborn , because she does n't pronounce `` M'Lord '' the way commoners do , instead saying `` My Lord , '' and possesses an educated vocabulary . <entity class="NE" id=3258>Arya</entity> makes the excuse that her Mother , whom she said was a handmaiden for years to royalty , had taught her to speak properly like them . In <entity class="NE" id=3260>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity class="NE" id=3261>Sansa Stark</entity> comes to thank <entity class="NE" id=3262>Sandor</entity> `` The <entity class="NE" id=3263>Hound</entity> '' <entity class="NE" id=3264>Clegane</entity> for saving her life during the recent riot in the city and says that he was very brave . <entity class="NE" id=3262>Sandor</entity> simply says that a dog does n't need courage to fight off rats . <entity class="NE" id=3266>Sansa</entity> is perturbed by his `` hateful speech , '' but <entity class="NE" id=3262>Sandor</entity> cautions that a day will come when his penchant for violence is all that stands between her and her `` beloved '' King Joffrey . <entity class="NE" id=3266>Sansa</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3269>Shae</entity> trying to flip the mattress . <entity class="NE" id=3266>Sansa</entity> awakens in her bed from a nightmare , only to find the sheets covered in blood–she has begun menstruating for the first time . Given that <entity class="NE" id=3271>Joffrey</entity> openly promised to rape <entity class="NE" id=3266>Sansa</entity> to `` put a son in you '' as soon as she had her blood , she then frantically tries to get rid of the bloody sheets to remove the evidence . <entity class="NE" id=3269>Shae</entity> tries to help <entity class="NE" id=3266>Sansa</entity> hide the sheets but <entity class="NE" id=3262>Sandor</entity> finds them . Terrified of being brought to <entity class="NE" id=3271>Joffrey</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3266>Sansa</entity> is instead brought before <entity class="NE" id=3278>Queen Regent Cersei Lannister</entity> , who awkwardly tries to comfort her . <entity class="NE" id=3279>Cersei</entity> presents <entity class="NE" id=3266>Sansa</entity> with warped advice on <entity class="NE" id=3271>Joffrey</entity> , bizarre counseling based on her bitter marriage with King <entity class="NE" id=3282>Robert Baratheon</entity> . Blithely waving away her son 's torment of <entity class="NE" id=3266>Sansa</entity> and homicidal outbursts she says that her brother <entity class="NE" id=3284>Jaime Lannister</entity> stayed by her side the whole time she was giving birth to <entity class="NE" id=3271>Joffrey</entity> , but <entity class="NE" id=3266>Sansa</entity> should never expect such devotion from <entity class="NE" id=3271>Joffrey</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3279>Cersei</entity> firmly believes that <entity class="NE" id=3266>Sansa</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3271>Joffrey</entity> not being in love is a good thing ; she advises <entity class="NE" id=3266>Sansa</entity> `` the more people you love , the weaker you are . '' <entity class="NE" id=3279>Cersei</entity> says that no one expects her to love <entity class="NE" id=3271>Joffrey</entity> , though she may take comfort in her love for the children they will have . Privately , <entity class="NE" id=3279>Cersei</entity> meets with <entity class="NE" id=3292>Tyrion</entity> and expresses regret at having children with her own brother Jaime . She wonders if <entity class="NE" id=3271>Joffrey</entity> 's violent personality is the price of her and <entity class="NE" id=3225>Jaime</entity> 's sins . <entity class="NE" id=3292>Tyrion</entity> earnestly points out that her other two children , <entity class="NE" id=3296>Myrcella</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3297>Tommen</entity> , are not monsters , and they share an odd moment of sympathy . <entity class="NE" id=3298>Torrhen Torrhen</entity> discovers the body of <entity class="NE" id=3299>Alton Lannister</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=3300>King Robb Stark</entity> 's army camp in the <entity class="NE" id=3301>Westerlands</entity> , close to an unidentified keep , <entity class="NE" id=3299>Alton Lannister</entity> returns as an envoy giving <entity class="NE" id=3303>Queen Cersei</entity> 's response to <entity class="NE" id=3304>Robb</entity> 's peace terms . <entity class="NE" id=3304>Robb</entity> is unsurprised that she rejected them and imprisons <entity class="NE" id=3306>Alton</entity> with his cousin <entity class="NE" id=3284>Jaime Lannister</entity> . The nurse <entity class="NE" id=3308>Talisa Maegyr</entity> discusses medical supplies she needs with <entity class="NE" id=3304>Robb</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3304>Robb</entity> suggests she accompany him to the <entity class="NE" id=3311>Crag</entity> to acquire the supplies she needs . That night , <entity class="NE" id=3225>Jaime</entity> kills <entity class="NE" id=3306>Alton</entity> to lure the guard , <entity class="NE" id=3314>Torrhen Karstark</entity> , into his cell . <entity class="NE" id=3225>Jaime</entity> strangles <entity class="NE" id=3316>Torrhen</entity> and escapes , but is soon recaptured . <entity class="NE" id=3316>Torrhen</entity> was the son of <entity class="NE" id=3318>Lord Rickard Karstark</entity> , one of the major nobles from the <entity class="NE" id=3319>North</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3320>Lord Lord</entity> demands <entity class="NE" id=3225>Jaime</entity> 's execution in revenge , regardless of his protected status as both a prisoner of war and a valuable political hostage . <entity class="NE" id=3322>Catelyn</entity> is forced to argue for <entity class="NE" id=3225>Jaime</entity> 's life . <entity class="NE" id=3322>Catelyn</entity> confronts Jaime and tells him that he has no honor . Jaime bitterly explains that his vows as a knight required him to defend the innocent and serve the king , but his king was slaughtering the innocent . <entity class="NE" id=3225>Jaime</entity> considers concepts like `` honor '' and `` loyalty '' naïve at best and hypocritical at worst . <entity class="NE" id=3225>Jaime</entity> asserts that he has only been with <entity class="NE" id=3279>Cersei</entity> and begins to ridicule <entity class="NE" id=3328>Eddard Stark</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3322>Catelyn</entity> 's late husband , by bringing up the shame of <entity class="NE" id=3330>Eddard</entity> fathering a bastard . This brings <entity class="NE" id=3322>Catelyn</entity> to breaking point and she asks for <entity class="NE" id=3332>Brienne</entity> 's sword . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=3333>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3334>Jon Jon</entity> is still separated from the <entity class="NE" id=3335>Night</entity> 's Watch scouting group led by <entity class="NE" id=3336>Qhorin Halfhand</entity> . He attempts to locate them , traveling with his wildling prisoner <entity class="NE" id=3337>Ygritte</entity> . She argues with <entity class="NE" id=3338>Jon</entity> , criticizing him for ignoring their common descent from the <entity class="NE" id=3339>First Men</entity> . She states that the animosity of the southerners to the <entity class="NE" id=3340>Wildlings</entity> is arbitrary , given that the Wildlings are only distinguished from them by living north of the Wall when it was constructed . She mocks <entity class="NE" id=3338>Jon</entity> 's sexual repression and surmises that he is a virgin . She taunts him by offering to teach him how to have sex . She escapes and leads him into an ambush . <entity class="NE" id=3337>Ygritte</entity> says that <entity class="NE" id=3338>Jon</entity> should have taken her when he had the chance . In <entity class="NE" id=3344>Qarth</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3345>Daenerys Daenerys</entity> is desperate to find her stolen dragons . Ser Ser returns and she orders him to find them . <entity class="NE" id=3346>Xaro Xaro</entity> claims to be distressed at breaking his promise to protect her , fearing that his word will be publicly seen as worthless . <entity class="NE" id=3347>Jorah</entity> questions Quaithe of <entity class="NE" id=3348>Asshai</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3349>Quaithe</entity> knows that <entity class="NE" id=3347>Jorah</entity> once betrayed <entity class="NE" id=3351>Daenerys</entity> by spying on her . <entity class="NE" id=3349>Quaithe</entity> warns <entity class="NE" id=3347>Jorah</entity> that the man who stole the dragons is already with <entity class="NE" id=3351>Daenerys</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3347>Jorah</entity> finds <entity class="NE" id=3351>Daenerys</entity> , in the company of <entity class="NE" id=3357>Kovarro</entity> , pleading with the council of The Thirteen to find her dragons . The warlock <entity class="NE" id=3358>Pyat Pree</entity> confesses to stealing the dragons and declares Xaro the King of <entity class="NE" id=3344>Qarth</entity> . Doubles of the warlock then magically appear behind the other members of the <entity class="NE" id=3360>Thirteen</entity> and slit their throats , leaving only <entity class="NE" id=3358>Pyat Pree</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3362>Xaro</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3362>Xaro</entity> secretly entered into an alliance with <entity class="NE" id=3358>Pyat Pree</entity> to become king . <entity class="NE" id=3358>Pyat Pree</entity> urges <entity class="NE" id=3351>Daenerys</entity> to find her dragons at the House of the Undying as the three flee .
