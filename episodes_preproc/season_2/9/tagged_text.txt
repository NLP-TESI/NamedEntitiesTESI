A massive battle rages for control of <entity class="NE" id=3460>King</entity> 's Landing and the <entity class="NE" id=3461>Iron Throne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3462>Bronn</entity> singing with the <entity class="NE" id=3463>Lannister</entity> soldiers . <entity class="NE" id=3464>Tyrion Lannister</entity> leads the defense of <entity class="NE" id=3460>King</entity> 's Landing against an assault by King <entity class="NE" id=3466>Stannis Baratheon</entity> in the <entity class="NE" id=3467>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3468>Blackwater</entity> . He spends the night before the expected siege in bed with <entity class="NE" id=3469>Shae</entity> , telling her she can still leave the city . <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> has Varys provide him with a map of the tunnel network beneath the city . <entity class="NE" id=3471>Varys</entity> tells Tyrion that he is all that stands between them and defeat . <entity class="NE" id=3462>Bronn</entity> drinks with the Lannister men and has a confrontation with the <entity class="NE" id=3473>Hound</entity> , who is here first beginning to show the emotional and political fluctuations he will experience in the coming battle and which will shape his destiny for the rest of the series . <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> plans a naval assault aiming to overcome the city 's small defensive fleet and land his troops at the walls of the city near the <entity class="NE" id=3475>Mud Gate</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3462>Bronn</entity> fires the arrow that triggers the wildfire explosion . From the battlements , <entity class="NE" id=3477>Joffrey</entity> berates <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> , demanding to know why his ships are not meeting <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> 's fleet . <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> has anticipated his strategy and does not field his fleet . Instead he sends a single ship filled with <entity class="NE" id=3481>Wildfire</entity> into the heart of <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> 's fleet , leaking the volatile substance over the surface of the water . <entity class="NE" id=3462>Bronn</entity> has been awaiting <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> 's signal outside the city on the shores of the bay , and when <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> tosses a torch from the battlements , <entity class="NE" id=3462>Bronn</entity> fires a flaming arrow triggering a massive , massive aquatic explosion . The ensuing conflagration devastates <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> 's fleet and destroys the ship of his high captain , <entity class="NE" id=3486>Davos Seaworth</entity> , as well as killing <entity class="NE" id=3487>Davos</entity> 's son , <entity class="NE" id=3488>Matthos</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3489>Sandor</entity> breaks down . <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> responds by putting his men ashore inside row boats , landing further from the walls to avoid the still burning inner bay . With less protection for his troops he predicts that thousands will die . He leads the assault personally and is the first to reach the walls . <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> orders <entity class="NE" id=3492>Sandor Clegane</entity> to lead a sortie beyond the <entity class="NE" id=3475>Mud Gate</entity> to repel the attackers . <entity class="NE" id=3489>Sandor</entity> does as asked but is terrified by the fire and breaks down emotionally . Ser Ser accompanies him and is wounded by an arrow . <entity class="NE" id=3462>Bronn</entity> joins the fight in time to save the <entity class="NE" id=3473>Hound</entity> 's life . The <entity class="NE" id=3473>Hound</entity> retreats after losing half of his men and refuses to go out again . He demands wine and walks away from the battle and his place in the <entity class="NE" id=3498>Kingsguard</entity> , after saying in the presence of all , including the king , `` Fuck the kings guard . Fuck the city . Fuck the king . `` . Queen Regent <entity class="NE" id=3499>Cersei Lannister</entity> offers protection to the ladies of the court in <entity class="NE" id=3500>Maegor</entity> 's Holdfast . She had earlier obtained Essence of <entity class="NE" id=3501>Nightshade</entity> ( which is deadly unless taken in tiny amounts ) from <entity class="NE" id=3502>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> and keeps the headsman <entity class="NE" id=3503>Ser Ilyn Payne</entity> at her side at all times , preparing for the worst . She drinks wine heavily during the assault and seems , to simultaneously torment and mother her captive , <entity class="NE" id=3504>Sansa Stark</entity> , with a sort of cynical feminism involving dire descriptions of the rapes that will occur if the city falls . She also begins to question <entity class="NE" id=3469>Shae</entity> , who seems to her perhaps an unlikely handmaiden . When <entity class="NE" id=3506>Lancel</entity> comes to tell her that <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> has reached the walls <entity class="NE" id=3508>Cersei</entity> orders him to bring <entity class="NE" id=3477>Joffrey</entity> back to the <entity class="NE" id=3510>Red Keep</entity> , ignoring his protests that it would damage morale . <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> rallies the troops . <entity class="NE" id=3477>Joffrey</entity> willingly leaves the defensive line with <entity class="NE" id=3506>Lancel</entity> and charges <entity class="NE" id=3514>Ser Mandon Moore</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3515>Ser Boros Blount</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3498>Kingsguard</entity> to fight in the King 's name . The gold cloaks ' morale is broken by his departure . <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> steels himself to lead a sortie of his own . He rallies his men by telling them to fight for their city , their homes and their women , if not for their king and utters his famous line , `` Those are brave men are knocking at our door . Let 's go kill them ! '' He leads his men through the tunnels beneath the city and is able to defeat <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> 's troops manning a battering ram at the <entity class="NE" id=3475>Mud Gate</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> is betrayed by <entity class="NE" id=3521>Ser Mandon</entity> while fighting against a group of reinforcements . <entity class="NE" id=3522>Mandon</entity> slashes Tyrion across the face with his sword . Before he can strike <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> again , <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> 's squire <entity class="NE" id=3524>Podrick Payne</entity> kills <entity class="NE" id=3521>Ser Mandon</entity> from behind with his spear . <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> , barely conscious and held by <entity class="NE" id=3527>Podrick</entity> watches a battle that seems lost . <entity class="NE" id=3506>Lancel</entity> wounded by arrow to shoulder . <entity class="NE" id=3506>Lancel</entity> returns to <entity class="NE" id=3508>Cersei</entity> to warn that they are defeated unless <entity class="NE" id=3477>Joffrey</entity> returns . When <entity class="NE" id=3506>Lancel</entity> tries to be firm with her , <entity class="NE" id=3508>Cersei</entity> ignores his counsel , pushes him out of the way ( deliberately causing him pain by hitting his injured side ) , and storms out . <entity class="NE" id=3534>Sansa</entity> tries to keep up the morale of the other women , frightened by <entity class="NE" id=3508>Cersei</entity> 's sudden departure . <entity class="NE" id=3534>Sansa</entity> leads them in singing a hymn . <entity class="NE" id=3508>Cersei</entity> has taken <entity class="NE" id=3538>Tommen</entity> to the throne room . She sits with him on the <entity class="NE" id=3461>Iron Throne</entity> , and tells him a story about a young lion and how it did not need to fear other beasts of the forest , the wolf and the stag . As she does this , she readies the poison for herself and for her son . <entity class="NE" id=3469>Shae</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=3534>Sansa</entity> to go to her chambers , lock herself in , and await <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> , as he would not harm her , but <entity class="NE" id=3543>Ser Ilyn</entity> might . <entity class="NE" id=3534>Sansa</entity> finds the <entity class="NE" id=3473>Hound</entity> waiting in her room . He offers to take her north to <entity class="NE" id=3546>Winterfell</entity> , but she says she will be safe there when <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> takes the throne . <entity class="NE" id=3508>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3538>Tommen</entity> on the <entity class="NE" id=3461>Iron Throne</entity> as the battle rages . The <entity class="NE" id=3473>Hound</entity> scares <entity class="NE" id=3534>Sansa</entity> , but tells her to look at him , saying that since the world is made up of killers like <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> , her father , her brother <entity class="NE" id=3554>Robb</entity> , and he himself , she better get used to looking at them . Though he promises to protect her , she is still too afraid of him to go with him . <entity class="NE" id=3508>Cersei</entity> sits on the <entity class="NE" id=3461>Iron Throne</entity> and prepares to poison <entity class="NE" id=3538>Tommen</entity> in order to prevent him from being taken captive . <entity class="NE" id=3558>Tywin</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3559>Loras</entity> lead their victorious forces into the throne room . The forces of <entity class="NE" id=3560>Tywin Lannister</entity> and , it is revealed , his new allies in <entity class="HSE" id=3561>House Tyrell</entity> join the battle . Their cavalry charge is led by a warrior dressed in the armor of <entity class="NE" id=3562>Renly Baratheon</entity> and it decimates <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> 's army . The survivors flee to their ships . <entity class="NE" id=3474>Stannis</entity> is dragged from the battle by his guards , screaming for his men to stand and fight . <entity class="NE" id=3470>Tyrion</entity> collapses into unconsciousness as the battle turns in the <entity class="NE" id=3566>Crown</entity> 's favor . <entity class="NE" id=3558>Tywin</entity> bursts into the throne room and announces their victory , just in time to stop <entity class="NE" id=3508>Cersei</entity> from killing <entity class="NE" id=3538>Tommen</entity> . Ser Ser reveals himself as the knight wearing <entity class="NE" id=3570>Renly</entity> 's armor .
