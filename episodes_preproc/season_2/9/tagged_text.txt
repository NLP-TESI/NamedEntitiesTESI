A massive battle rages for control of <entity id=3484>King</entity> 's Landing and the <entity id=3485>Iron Throne</entity> . <entity id=3486>Bronn</entity> singing with the <entity id=3487>Lannister</entity> soldiers . <entity id=3488>Tyrion Lannister</entity> leads the defense of <entity id=3489>King</entity> 's Landing against an assault by King <entity id=3490>Stannis Baratheon</entity> in the <entity id=3491>Battle</entity> of the <entity id=3492>Blackwater</entity> . He spends the night before the expected siege in bed with <entity id=3493>Shae</entity> , telling her she can still leave the city . <entity id=3494>Tyrion</entity> has Varys provide him with a map of the tunnel network beneath the city . <entity id=3495>Varys</entity> tells Tyrion that he is all that stands between them and defeat . <entity id=3496>Bronn</entity> drinks with the Lannister men and has a confrontation with the <entity id=3497>Hound</entity> , who is here first beginning to show the emotional and political fluctuations he will experience in the coming battle and which will shape his destiny for the rest of the series . <entity id=3498>Stannis</entity> plans a naval assault aiming to overcome the city 's small defensive fleet and land his troops at the walls of the city near the <entity id=3499>Mud Gate</entity> . <entity id=3500>Bronn</entity> fires the arrow that triggers the wildfire explosion . From the battlements , <entity id=3501>Joffrey</entity> berates <entity id=3502>Tyrion</entity> , demanding to know why his ships are not meeting <entity id=3503>Stannis</entity> 's fleet . <entity id=3504>Tyrion</entity> has anticipated his strategy and does not field his fleet . Instead he sends a single ship filled with <entity id=3505>Wildfire</entity> into the heart of <entity id=3506>Stannis</entity> 's fleet , leaking the volatile substance over the surface of the water . <entity id=3507>Bronn</entity> has been awaiting <entity id=3508>Tyrion</entity> 's signal outside the city on the shores of the bay , and when <entity id=3508>Tyrion</entity> tosses a torch from the battlements , <entity id=3507>Bronn</entity> fires a flaming arrow triggering a massive , massive aquatic explosion . The ensuing conflagration devastates <entity id=3509>Stannis</entity> 's fleet and destroys the ship of his high captain , <entity id=3510>Davos Seaworth</entity> , as well as killing <entity id=3511>Davos</entity> 's son , <entity id=3512>Matthos</entity> . <entity id=3513>Sandor</entity> breaks down . <entity id=3514>Stannis</entity> responds by putting his men ashore inside row boats , landing further from the walls to avoid the still burning inner bay . With less protection for his troops he predicts that thousands will die . He leads the assault personally and is the first to reach the walls . <entity id=3515>Tyrion</entity> orders <entity id=3516>Sandor Clegane</entity> to lead a sortie beyond the <entity id=3517>Mud Gate</entity> to repel the attackers . <entity id=3518>Sandor</entity> does as asked but is terrified by the fire and breaks down emotionally . <entity id=3519>Ser Ser</entity> accompanies him and is wounded by an arrow . <entity id=3520>Bronn</entity> joins the fight in time to save the <entity id=3521>Hound</entity> 's life . The <entity id=3522>Hound</entity> retreats after losing half of his men and refuses to go out again . He demands wine and walks away from the battle and his place in the <entity id=3523>Kingsguard</entity> , after saying in the presence of all , including the king , `` Fuck the kings guard . Fuck the city . Fuck the king . `` . Queen Regent <entity id=3524>Cersei Lannister</entity> offers protection to the ladies of the court in <entity id=3525>Maegor</entity> 's Holdfast . She had earlier obtained Essence of <entity id=3526>Nightshade</entity> ( which is deadly unless taken in tiny amounts ) from <entity id=3527>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> and keeps the headsman <entity id=3528>Ser Ilyn Payne</entity> at her side at all times , preparing for the worst . She drinks wine heavily during the assault and seems , to simultaneously torment and mother her captive , <entity id=3529>Sansa Stark</entity> , with a sort of cynical feminism involving dire descriptions of the rapes that will occur if the city falls . She also begins to question <entity id=3530>Shae</entity> , who seems to her perhaps an unlikely handmaiden . When <entity id=3531>Lancel</entity> comes to tell her that <entity id=3532>Stannis</entity> has reached the walls <entity id=3533>Cersei</entity> orders him to bring <entity id=3534>Joffrey</entity> back to the <entity id=3535>Red Keep</entity> , ignoring his protests that it would damage morale . <entity id=3536>Tyrion</entity> rallies the troops . <entity id=3537>Joffrey</entity> willingly leaves the defensive line with <entity id=3538>Lancel</entity> and charges <entity id=3539>Ser Mandon Moore</entity> and <entity id=3540>Ser Boros Blount</entity> of the <entity id=3541>Kingsguard</entity> to fight in the King 's name . The gold cloaks ' morale is broken by his departure . <entity id=3542>Tyrion</entity> steels himself to lead a sortie of his own . He rallies his men by telling them to fight for their city , their homes and their women , if not for their king and utters his famous line , `` Those are brave men are knocking at our door . Let 's go kill them ! '' He leads his men through the tunnels beneath the city and is able to defeat <entity id=3543>Stannis</entity> 's troops manning a battering ram at the <entity id=3544>Mud Gate</entity> . <entity id=3545>Tyrion</entity> is betrayed by <entity id=3546>Ser Mandon</entity> while fighting against a group of reinforcements . <entity id=3547>Mandon</entity> slashes Tyrion across the face with his sword . Before he can strike <entity id=3548>Tyrion</entity> again , <entity id=3548>Tyrion</entity> 's squire <entity id=3549>Podrick Payne</entity> kills <entity id=3550>Ser Mandon</entity> from behind with his spear . <entity id=3551>Tyrion</entity> , barely conscious and held by <entity id=3552>Podrick</entity> watches a battle that seems lost . <entity id=3553>Lancel</entity> wounded by arrow to shoulder . <entity id=3554>Lancel</entity> returns to <entity id=3555>Cersei</entity> to warn that they are defeated unless <entity id=3556>Joffrey</entity> returns . When <entity id=3557>Lancel</entity> tries to be firm with her , <entity id=3558>Cersei</entity> ignores his counsel , pushes him out of the way ( deliberately causing him pain by hitting his injured side ) , and storms out . <entity id=3559>Sansa</entity> tries to keep up the morale of the other women , frightened by <entity id=3560>Cersei</entity> 's sudden departure . <entity id=3561>Sansa</entity> leads them in singing a hymn . <entity id=3562>Cersei</entity> has taken <entity id=3563>Tommen</entity> to the throne room . She sits with him on the <entity id=3564>Iron Throne</entity> , and tells him a story about a young lion and how it did not need to fear other beasts of the forest , the wolf and the stag . As she does this , she readies the poison for herself and for her son . <entity id=3565>Shae</entity> tells <entity id=3566>Sansa</entity> to go to her chambers , lock herself in , and await <entity id=3567>Stannis</entity> , as he would not harm her , but <entity id=3568>Ser Ilyn</entity> might . <entity id=3569>Sansa</entity> finds the <entity id=3570>Hound</entity> waiting in her room . He offers to take her north to <entity id=3571>Winterfell</entity> , but she says she will be safe there when <entity id=3572>Stannis</entity> takes the throne . <entity id=3573>Cersei</entity> and <entity id=3574>Tommen</entity> on the <entity id=3575>Iron Throne</entity> as the battle rages . The <entity id=3576>Hound</entity> scares <entity id=3577>Sansa</entity> , but tells her to look at him , saying that since the world is made up of killers like <entity id=3578>Stannis</entity> , her father , her brother <entity id=3579>Robb</entity> , and he himself , she better get used to looking at them . Though he promises to protect her , she is still too afraid of him to go with him . <entity id=3580>Cersei</entity> sits on the <entity id=3581>Iron Throne</entity> and prepares to poison <entity id=3582>Tommen</entity> in order to prevent him from being taken captive . <entity id=3583>Tywin</entity> and <entity id=3584>Loras</entity> lead their victorious forces into the throne room . The forces of <entity id=3585>Tywin Lannister</entity> and , it is revealed , his new allies in <entity id=3586>House Tyrell</entity> join the battle . Their cavalry charge is led by a warrior dressed in the armor of <entity id=3587>Renly Baratheon</entity> and it decimates <entity id=3588>Stannis</entity> 's army . The survivors flee to their ships . <entity id=3589>Stannis</entity> is dragged from the battle by his guards , screaming for his men to stand and fight . <entity id=3590>Tyrion</entity> collapses into unconsciousness as the battle turns in the <entity id=3591>Crown</entity> 's favor . <entity id=3592>Tywin</entity> bursts into the throne room and announces their victory , just in time to stop <entity id=3593>Cersei</entity> from killing <entity id=3594>Tommen</entity> . <entity id=3595>Ser Ser</entity> reveals himself as the knight wearing <entity id=3596>Renly</entity> 's armor .
