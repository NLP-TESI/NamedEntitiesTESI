At <entity class="NE" id=2270>Dragonstone</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2271>Stannis Baratheon</entity> begins his quest to take the <entity class="NE" id=2272>Iron Throne</entity> with the help of a mysterious foreign priestess . On the eastern continent , <entity class="NE" id=2273>Daenerys</entity> leads her people through the <entity class="NE" id=2274>Red Waste</entity> .

Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=2277>Wall</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=2278>Night's Watch</entity> approaches <entity class="NE" id=2279>Crasters Keep</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2280>Lord Lord</entity> 's rangers arrive at <entity class="NE" id=2281>Craster</entity> 's Keep having passed several abandoned wildling villages . <entity class="NE" id=2282>Jon Jon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2283>Grenn</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2284>Dolorous Edd</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2285>Samwell Tarly</entity> are repulsed by <entity class="NE" id=2286>Craster</entity> , who has many wives , most of whom are also his own daughters , but who seemingly has no sons . <entity class="NE" id=2287>Craster</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=2288>Jeor</entity> that he has not seen the missing <entity class="NE" id=2289>Benjen Stark</entity> and reports that the other wildlings are assembling for the King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder . <entity class="NE" id=2290>Jon</entity> challenges their host , who is low and crude , but is demanding and demeaning when he is talking to the noble <entity class="NE" id=2291>Commander Mormont</entity> ( who ignores his insulting behavior ) . When <entity class="NE" id=2292>Craster</entity> refers to them as southerners , <entity class="NE" id=2293>Jon</entity> argues with him . <entity class="NE" id=2294>Jeor</entity> reprimands <entity class="NE" id=2295>Jon</entity> , noting that <entity class="NE" id=2296>Craster</entity> may be disgusting , but the <entity class="NE" id=2297>Night's Watch</entity> needs him . His information and shelter in the harsh conditions north of the Wall have helped them many times before . <entity class="NE" id=2298>Mormont</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=2299>Jon</entity> if someday he wants to lead and tells him that first he needs to `` learn how to follow . `` . In the <entity class="NE" id=2300>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2301>Sansa</entity> watches King <entity class="NE" id=2302>Joffrey</entity> 's tournament . King <entity class="NE" id=2303>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> holds a tournament to celebrate his nameday on the walls of the <entity class="NE" id=2304>Red Keep</entity> . He is irritated by <entity class="NE" id=2305>Ser Dontos Hollard</entity> , who arrives both late and intoxicated for his bout . <entity class="NE" id=2306>Joffrey</entity> orders his guards to pour an entire barrel of wine down <entity class="NE" id=2307>Dontos</entity> ' throat with a funnel . <entity class="NE" id=2308>Sansa Sansa</entity> intercedes telling <entity class="NE" id=2309>Joffrey</entity> that ordering a death on one 's name day is bad luck . <entity class="NE" id=2310>Joffrey</entity> dismisses this as a mindless superstition , but <entity class="NE" id=2311>Sandor Clegane</entity> seconds her . <entity class="NE" id=2312>Sansa</entity> convinces <entity class="NE" id=2313>Joffrey</entity> to instead make <entity class="NE" id=2314>Dontos</entity> his court fool , for which <entity class="NE" id=2314>Dontos</entity> is grateful . <entity class="NE" id=2315>Tyrion Lannister</entity> arrives back in <entity class="NE" id=2316>King</entity> 's Landing , to <entity class="NE" id=2317>Joffrey</entity> 's disdain , but to the delight of <entity class="NE" id=2318>Tommen</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2319>Myrcella</entity> who had worried that he was dead . <entity class="NE" id=2320>Cersei</entity> is surprised to see <entity class="NE" id=2321>Tyrion</entity> return .

When <entity class="NE" id=2325>Tyrion</entity> arrives with a letter from <entity class="NE" id=2326>Lord Tywin</entity> , appointing him as acting <entity class="NE" id=2327>Hand</entity> of the King in <entity class="NE" id=2328>Tywin</entity> 's stead , <entity class="NE" id=2329>Cersei</entity> becomes livid . She is suspicious that <entity class="NE" id=2330>Tyrion</entity> is taking power for himself , but he convinces her that he is there to act as an advisor . He criticizes his sister for failing to rein in <entity class="NE" id=2331>Joffrey</entity> and overseeing numerous bad decisions , particularly the execution of <entity class="NE" id=2332>Ned Stark</entity> . Their actions have sparked a war , which , he adds , their side is currently losing . He is even more incredulous when he learns that <entity class="NE" id=2333>Arya Stark</entity> escaped , pointing out how much stronger their position could have been with three Stark hostages . <entity class="NE" id=2334>Tyrion</entity> hides his lover Shae in his chambers in the Tower of the <entity class="NE" id=2335>Hand</entity> because he was forbidden by his father to bring her with him . She is initially thrilled at being brought to the capitol , and says that big cities make her `` want to fuck '' . At <entity class="NE" id=2336>Winterfell</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2337>Bran Stark</entity> suffers through the petty complaints of his vassals , facing unrest at <entity class="NE" id=2338>Robb Stark</entity> calling his banners and taking the young men south . <entity class="NE" id=2339>Maester Maester</entity> guides him in carrying out a lord 's duties . <entity class="NE" id=2340>Bran</entity> dreams that he is his direwolf Summer walking in the <entity class="NE" id=2341>Godswood</entity> , and when he looks in the pool , he sees <entity class="NE" id=2342>Summer</entity> 's reflection not his own which wakes him . He has Osha and Hodor take him to the pool and is reassured to find that his waking reflection is his own . They discuss the phenomenon of the <entity class="NE" id=2343>Red Comet</entity> , as many people think it means different things . <entity class="NE" id=2344>Osha</entity> tells him she believes it signifies the return of dragons to the world . <entity class="NE" id=2345>Stannis</entity> orders the burning of the Seven to honor the <entity class="NE" id=2346>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=2347>Light</entity> . On the island of <entity class="NE" id=2348>Dragonstone</entity> , King <entity class="NE" id=2349>Stannis Baratheon</entity> allows his advisor <entity class="NE" id=2350>Melisandre</entity> to burn statues of the gods of the <entity class="NE" id=2351>Faith</entity> of the Seven as an offering to her deity the <entity class="NE" id=2352>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=2353>Light</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2354>Maester Maester</entity> is outraged at the affront to his gods and fearful that <entity class="NE" id=2355>Melisandre</entity> is leading <entity class="NE" id=2356>Stannis</entity> into a war that he can not win . <entity class="NE" id=2357>Melisandre</entity> proclaims <entity class="NE" id=2358>Stannis</entity> a champion of the <entity class="NE" id=2359>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=2360>Light</entity> , as he draws a burning sword from one of the statues . <entity class="NE" id=2361>Cressen</entity> asks <entity class="NE" id=2362>Davos Seaworth</entity> to help him intervene but <entity class="NE" id=2363>Davos</entity> says that it is not the right time . <entity class="NE" id=2364>Stannis</entity> dictates a letter about <entity class="NE" id=2365>Joffrey</entity> 's parentage . <entity class="NE" id=2366>Stannis</entity> has received <entity class="NE" id=2367>Ned Stark</entity> 's letter , informing him that he was the true heir of King <entity class="NE" id=2368>Robert Baratheon</entity> , so he will send copies of a letter announcing his claim to the throne of the <entity class="NE" id=2369>Seven Kingdoms</entity> to Lords throughout the realm . He details the incestuous relationship between <entity class="NE" id=2370>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2371>Jaime Lannister</entity> and challenges <entity class="NE" id=2372>Joffrey</entity> 's legitimacy . He rejects <entity class="NE" id=2373>Davos</entity> 's appeal to consider an alliance with his brother <entity class="NE" id=2374>Renly Baratheon</entity> , while <entity class="NE" id=2375>Renly</entity> is claiming the throne for himself , despite Renly having widespread support , or even with <entity class="NE" id=2376>Robb Stark</entity> , since while <entity class="NE" id=2377>Robb</entity> does not seek the <entity class="NE" id=2378>Iron Throne</entity> , he desires <entity class="NE" id=2379>Northern</entity> independence , which <entity class="NE" id=2380>Stannis</entity> sees as <entity class="NE" id=2377>Robb</entity> `` stealing the <entity class="NE" id=2379>Northern</entity> half of his kingdom . '' <entity class="NE" id=2381>Cressen</entity> feigns an apology in an effort to trick <entity class="NE" id=2382>Melisandre</entity> into sharing a cup of poisoned wine with him . <entity class="NE" id=2383>Davos</entity> sees him drop the poison in the cup , and tries to stop him . He drinks first and hands the cup to her . <entity class="NE" id=2384>Melisandre</entity> is aware of what <entity class="NE" id=2385>Cressen</entity> is doing , but smiling she drinks anyway and is unaffected by the poison , and <entity class="NE" id=2385>Cressen</entity> dies in vain . <entity class="NE" id=2386>Robb</entity> confronts Jaime with his direwolf . <entity class="NE" id=2387>Grey Grey</entity> and Jaime . <entity class="NE" id=2388>Robb</entity> receives the letter and interrogates the captive Jaime about his reasons for crippling <entity class="NE" id=2389>Bran</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2390>Jaime</entity> reveals nothing and attacks <entity class="NE" id=2391>Robb</entity> 's decision to keep him in his mobile camp rather than with one of his bannermen as demonstrating a lack of trust . <entity class="NE" id=2392>Robb</entity> asserts his faith in his men and his concern at the lengths <entity class="HSE" id=2393>House Lannister</entity> would go to in order to free Jaime . His direwolf <entity class="NE" id=2394>Grey Wind</entity> is almost fully grown and menaces Jaime during the questioning . <entity class="NE" id=2395>Robb</entity> sends his prisoner <entity class="NE" id=2396>Alton Lannister</entity> to <entity class="NE" id=2397>King</entity> 's Landing with peace terms . His demands include the release of his sisters , the return of his father 's remains along with the remains of all those who served him , and the recognition of the <entity class="NE" id=2398>North</entity> as a free and independent kingdom . Theon Greyjoy appeals to Robb to send him to <entity class="NE" id=2399>Pyke</entity> to seek an alliance with his father Balon citing their need for a fleet in order to attack <entity class="NE" id=2400>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity class="NE" id=2401>Catelyn</entity> counsels against putting trust in <entity class="NE" id=2402>Balon</entity> because of his history of rebellion . She asks <entity class="NE" id=2403>Robb</entity> to consider exchanging <entity class="NE" id=2404>Jaime</entity> for his sisters . She then asks to return to her younger sons at <entity class="NE" id=2405>Winterfell</entity> but <entity class="NE" id=2406>Robb</entity> tasks her with seeking an alliance with <entity class="NE" id=2407>Renly</entity> and sends <entity class="NE" id=2408>Ser Rodrik Cassel</entity> instead to <entity class="NE" id=2405>Winterfell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2409>Cersei</entity> asks a favor of <entity class="NE" id=2410>Lord Baelish</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2411>Cersei</entity> tasks <entity class="NE" id=2412>Petyr Baelish</entity> with finding <entity class="NE" id=2413>Arya</entity> . She needles Petyr about his unrequited love for <entity class="NE" id=2414>Catelyn</entity> and he counters by referencing her relationship with <entity class="NE" id=2415>Jaime</entity> , telling her that knowledge is power . She responds by threatening his life in a demonstration of her control over her guards , ordering them to first seize <entity class="NE" id=2416>Baelish</entity> and cut his throat and almost immediately rescinding the order . She warns him that power is power . <entity class="NE" id=2417>Joffrey</entity> redecorates his throne room , hoping to restore the intimidating grandeur it held under the <entity class="NE" id=2418>Targaryens</entity> . He refuses his mother 's suggestion that they ask <entity class="NE" id=2419>Tywin Lannister</entity> for aid in the search for <entity class="NE" id=2420>Arya</entity> because he does not feel it is necessary to find her and does not feel it is fitting for a king to ask for help . He blames <entity class="NE" id=2421>Tywin</entity> for their losses in the war and the capture of <entity class="NE" id=2422>Jaime</entity> . Having heard rumors about his parentage , he confronts his mother . She dismisses it as gossip spread by his enemies . He questions her about his father 's bastard children and insults her by saying that <entity class="NE" id=2423>Robert</entity> had grown tired of her . She slaps him , and he warns her never to hit him again under threat of death . <entity class="NE" id=2424>Lord Lord</entity> leads a city-wide massacre of <entity class="NE" id=2425>Robert</entity> 's bastards .

He says that <entity class="NE" id=2432>Gendry</entity> can be identified by his bull 's head helm . <entity class="NE" id=2433>Gendry</entity> and Arya are travelling north on the <entity class="NE" id=2434>Kingsroad</entity> with <entity class="NE" id=2435>Yoren</entity> 's recruits . Across the <entity class="NE" id=2436>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2437>Daenerys</entity> leads her people through the <entity class="NE" id=2438>Red Waste</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2439>Daenerys Daenerys</entity> leads her diminished khalasar east into the <entity class="NE" id=2440>Red Waste</entity> to avoid her rivals . She is surrounded by powerful enemies who Ser <entity class="NE" id=2441>Jorah</entity> tells her will kill her and take her dragons . The deadly emptiness of the <entity class="NE" id=2442>Red Waste</entity> is her only option . She struggles to make her dragons eat what little meat she has , and her people face starvation . Her beloved white mare , her first gift from <entity class="NE" id=2443>Khal Drogo</entity> , dies prompting her to halt the march and send three of her bloodriders in three different directions to scout for sustenance and refuge .
