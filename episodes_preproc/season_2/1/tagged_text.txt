Under the burning <entity id=2281>Red Comet</entity> in the sky , war grips the continent of <entity id=2282>Westeros</entity> . In <entity id=2283>King</entity> 's Landing , <entity id=2284>Tyrion Lannister</entity> arrives at court to serve as acting <entity id=2285>Hand</entity> of the King , and to rein in his crazed nephew King Joffrey , as well as <entity id=2286>Queen Regent Cersei</entity> . At <entity id=2287>Dragonstone</entity> , <entity id=2288>Stannis Baratheon</entity> begins his quest to take the <entity id=2289>Iron Throne</entity> with the help of a mysterious foreign priestess . On the eastern continent , <entity id=2290>Daenerys</entity> leads her people through the <entity id=2291>Red Waste</entity> . Beyond the <entity id=2292>Wall</entity> , rangers , led by <entity id=2293>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</entity> , seek help from a dangerous wildling . Beyond the <entity id=2294>Wall</entity> . The <entity id=2295>Night's Watch</entity> approaches <entity id=2296>Crasters Keep</entity> . <entity id=2297>Lord Lord</entity> 's rangers arrive at <entity id=2298>Craster</entity> 's Keep having passed several abandoned wildling villages . <entity id=2299>Jon Jon</entity> , <entity id=2300>Grenn</entity> , <entity id=2301>Dolorous Edd</entity> and <entity id=2302>Samwell Tarly</entity> are repulsed by <entity id=2303>Craster</entity> , who has many wives , most of whom are also his own daughters , but who seemingly has no sons . <entity id=2304>Craster</entity> tells <entity id=2305>Jeor</entity> that he has not seen the missing <entity id=2306>Benjen Stark</entity> and reports that the other wildlings are assembling for the King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder . <entity id=2307>Jon</entity> challenges their host , who is low and crude , but is demanding and demeaning when he is talking to the noble <entity id=2308>Commander Mormont</entity> ( who ignores his insulting behavior ) . When <entity id=2309>Craster</entity> refers to them as southerners , <entity id=2310>Jon</entity> argues with him . <entity id=2311>Jeor</entity> reprimands <entity id=2312>Jon</entity> , noting that <entity id=2313>Craster</entity> may be disgusting , but the <entity id=2314>Night's Watch</entity> needs him . His information and shelter in the harsh conditions north of the Wall have helped them many times before . <entity id=2315>Mormont</entity> asks <entity id=2316>Jon</entity> if someday he wants to lead and tells him that first he needs to `` learn how to follow . `` . In the <entity id=2317>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . <entity id=2318>Sansa</entity> watches King <entity id=2319>Joffrey</entity> 's tournament . King <entity id=2320>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> holds a tournament to celebrate his nameday on the walls of the <entity id=2321>Red Keep</entity> . He is irritated by <entity id=2322>Ser Dontos Hollard</entity> , who arrives both late and intoxicated for his bout . <entity id=2323>Joffrey</entity> orders his guards to pour an entire barrel of wine down <entity id=2324>Dontos</entity> ' throat with a funnel . <entity id=2325>Sansa Sansa</entity> intercedes telling <entity id=2326>Joffrey</entity> that ordering a death on one 's name day is bad luck . <entity id=2327>Joffrey</entity> dismisses this as a mindless superstition , but <entity id=2328>Sandor Clegane</entity> seconds her . <entity id=2329>Sansa</entity> convinces <entity id=2330>Joffrey</entity> to instead make <entity id=2331>Dontos</entity> his court fool , for which <entity id=2331>Dontos</entity> is grateful . <entity id=2332>Tyrion Lannister</entity> arrives back in <entity id=2333>King</entity> 's Landing , to <entity id=2334>Joffrey</entity> 's disdain , but to the delight of <entity id=2335>Tommen</entity> and <entity id=2336>Myrcella</entity> who had worried that he was dead . <entity id=2337>Cersei</entity> is surprised to see <entity id=2338>Tyrion</entity> return . The small council are in session to discuss the <entity id=2339>Conclave</entity> 's announcement that the long summer has ended . <entity id=2340>Cersei</entity> orders the city gates closed to refugees from the war in the <entity id=2341>Riverlands</entity> . When <entity id=2342>Tyrion</entity> arrives with a letter from <entity id=2343>Lord Tywin</entity> , appointing him as acting <entity id=2344>Hand</entity> of the King in <entity id=2345>Tywin</entity> 's stead , <entity id=2346>Cersei</entity> becomes livid . She is suspicious that <entity id=2347>Tyrion</entity> is taking power for himself , but he convinces her that he is there to act as an advisor . He criticizes his sister for failing to rein in <entity id=2348>Joffrey</entity> and overseeing numerous bad decisions , particularly the execution of <entity id=2349>Ned Stark</entity> . Their actions have sparked a war , which , he adds , their side is currently losing . He is even more incredulous when he learns that <entity id=2350>Arya Stark</entity> escaped , pointing out how much stronger their position could have been with three Stark hostages . <entity id=2351>Tyrion</entity> hides his lover Shae in his chambers in the Tower of the <entity id=2352>Hand</entity> because he was forbidden by his father to bring her with him . She is initially thrilled at being brought to the capitol , and says that big cities make her `` want to fuck '' . At <entity id=2353>Winterfell</entity> , <entity id=2354>Bran Stark</entity> suffers through the petty complaints of his vassals , facing unrest at <entity id=2355>Robb Stark</entity> calling his banners and taking the young men south . <entity id=2356>Maester Maester</entity> guides him in carrying out a lord 's duties . <entity id=2357>Bran</entity> dreams that he is his direwolf Summer walking in the <entity id=2358>Godswood</entity> , and when he looks in the pool , he sees <entity id=2359>Summer</entity> 's reflection not his own which wakes him . He has Osha and Hodor take him to the pool and is reassured to find that his waking reflection is his own . They discuss the phenomenon of the <entity id=2360>Red Comet</entity> , as many people think it means different things . <entity id=2361>Osha</entity> tells him she believes it signifies the return of dragons to the world . <entity id=2362>Stannis</entity> orders the burning of the Seven to honor the <entity id=2363>Lord</entity> of <entity id=2364>Light</entity> . On the island of <entity id=2365>Dragonstone</entity> , King <entity id=2366>Stannis Baratheon</entity> allows his advisor <entity id=2367>Melisandre</entity> to burn statues of the gods of the <entity id=2368>Faith</entity> of the Seven as an offering to her deity the <entity id=2369>Lord</entity> of <entity id=2370>Light</entity> . <entity id=2371>Maester Maester</entity> is outraged at the affront to his gods and fearful that <entity id=2372>Melisandre</entity> is leading <entity id=2373>Stannis</entity> into a war that he can not win . <entity id=2374>Melisandre</entity> proclaims <entity id=2375>Stannis</entity> a champion of the <entity id=2376>Lord</entity> of <entity id=2377>Light</entity> , as he draws a burning sword from one of the statues . <entity id=2378>Cressen</entity> asks <entity id=2379>Davos Seaworth</entity> to help him intervene but <entity id=2380>Davos</entity> says that it is not the right time . <entity id=2381>Stannis</entity> dictates a letter about <entity id=2382>Joffrey</entity> 's parentage . <entity id=2383>Stannis</entity> has received <entity id=2384>Ned Stark</entity> 's letter , informing him that he was the true heir of King <entity id=2385>Robert Baratheon</entity> , so he will send copies of a letter announcing his claim to the throne of the <entity id=2386>Seven Kingdoms</entity> to Lords throughout the realm . He details the incestuous relationship between <entity id=2387>Cersei</entity> and <entity id=2388>Jaime Lannister</entity> and challenges <entity id=2389>Joffrey</entity> 's legitimacy . He rejects <entity id=2390>Davos</entity> 's appeal to consider an alliance with his brother <entity id=2391>Renly Baratheon</entity> , while <entity id=2392>Renly</entity> is claiming the throne for himself , despite Renly having widespread support , or even with <entity id=2393>Robb Stark</entity> , since while <entity id=2394>Robb</entity> does not seek the <entity id=2395>Iron Throne</entity> , he desires <entity id=2396>Northern</entity> independence , which <entity id=2397>Stannis</entity> sees as <entity id=2394>Robb</entity> `` stealing the <entity id=2396>Northern</entity> half of his kingdom . '' <entity id=2398>Cressen</entity> feigns an apology in an effort to trick <entity id=2399>Melisandre</entity> into sharing a cup of poisoned wine with him . <entity id=2400>Davos</entity> sees him drop the poison in the cup , and tries to stop him . He drinks first and hands the cup to her . <entity id=2401>Melisandre</entity> is aware of what <entity id=2402>Cressen</entity> is doing , but smiling she drinks anyway and is unaffected by the poison , and <entity id=2402>Cressen</entity> dies in vain . <entity id=2403>Robb</entity> confronts Jaime with his direwolf . <entity id=2404>Grey Grey</entity> and Jaime . <entity id=2405>Robb</entity> receives the letter and interrogates the captive Jaime about his reasons for crippling <entity id=2406>Bran</entity> . <entity id=2407>Jaime</entity> reveals nothing and attacks <entity id=2408>Robb</entity> 's decision to keep him in his mobile camp rather than with one of his bannermen as demonstrating a lack of trust . <entity id=2409>Robb</entity> asserts his faith in his men and his concern at the lengths <entity id=2410>House Lannister</entity> would go to in order to free Jaime . His direwolf <entity id=2411>Grey Wind</entity> is almost fully grown and menaces Jaime during the questioning . <entity id=2412>Robb</entity> sends his prisoner <entity id=2413>Alton Lannister</entity> to <entity id=2414>King</entity> 's Landing with peace terms . His demands include the release of his sisters , the return of his father 's remains along with the remains of all those who served him , and the recognition of the <entity id=2415>North</entity> as a free and independent kingdom . Theon Greyjoy appeals to Robb to send him to <entity id=2416>Pyke</entity> to seek an alliance with his father Balon citing their need for a fleet in order to attack <entity id=2417>King</entity> 's Landing . <entity id=2418>Catelyn</entity> counsels against putting trust in <entity id=2419>Balon</entity> because of his history of rebellion . She asks <entity id=2420>Robb</entity> to consider exchanging <entity id=2421>Jaime</entity> for his sisters . She then asks to return to her younger sons at <entity id=2422>Winterfell</entity> but <entity id=2423>Robb</entity> tasks her with seeking an alliance with <entity id=2424>Renly</entity> and sends <entity id=2425>Ser Rodrik Cassel</entity> instead to <entity id=2422>Winterfell</entity> . <entity id=2426>Cersei</entity> asks a favor of <entity id=2427>Lord Baelish</entity> . <entity id=2428>Cersei</entity> tasks <entity id=2429>Petyr Baelish</entity> with finding <entity id=2430>Arya</entity> . She needles Petyr about his unrequited love for <entity id=2431>Catelyn</entity> and he counters by referencing her relationship with <entity id=2432>Jaime</entity> , telling her that knowledge is power . She responds by threatening his life in a demonstration of her control over her guards , ordering them to first seize <entity id=2433>Baelish</entity> and cut his throat and almost immediately rescinding the order . She warns him that power is power . <entity id=2434>Joffrey</entity> redecorates his throne room , hoping to restore the intimidating grandeur it held under the <entity id=2435>Targaryens</entity> . He refuses his mother 's suggestion that they ask <entity id=2436>Tywin Lannister</entity> for aid in the search for <entity id=2437>Arya</entity> because he does not feel it is necessary to find her and does not feel it is fitting for a king to ask for help . He blames <entity id=2438>Tywin</entity> for their losses in the war and the capture of <entity id=2439>Jaime</entity> . Having heard rumors about his parentage , he confronts his mother . She dismisses it as gossip spread by his enemies . He questions her about his father 's bastard children and insults her by saying that <entity id=2440>Robert</entity> had grown tired of her . She slaps him , and he warns her never to hit him again under threat of death . <entity id=2441>Lord Lord</entity> leads a city-wide massacre of <entity id=2442>Robert</entity> 's bastards . The infant <entity id=2443>Barra</entity> is killed in <entity id=2444>Petyr</entity> 's brothel in front of her mother and the prostitute <entity id=2445>Ros</entity> . <entity id=2446>Tobho Tobho</entity> is interrogated and reveals that <entity id=2447>Gendry</entity> has left the city as a recruit of the <entity id=2448>Night's Watch</entity> . He says that <entity id=2449>Gendry</entity> can be identified by his bull 's head helm . <entity id=2450>Gendry</entity> and Arya are travelling north on the <entity id=2451>Kingsroad</entity> with <entity id=2452>Yoren</entity> 's recruits . Across the <entity id=2453>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity id=2454>Daenerys</entity> leads her people through the <entity id=2455>Red Waste</entity> . <entity id=2456>Daenerys Daenerys</entity> leads her diminished khalasar east into the <entity id=2457>Red Waste</entity> to avoid her rivals . She is surrounded by powerful enemies who Ser <entity id=2458>Jorah</entity> tells her will kill her and take her dragons . The deadly emptiness of the <entity id=2459>Red Waste</entity> is her only option . She struggles to make her dragons eat what little meat she has , and her people face starvation . Her beloved white mare , her first gift from <entity id=2460>Khal Drogo</entity> , dies prompting her to halt the march and send three of her bloodriders in three different directions to scout for sustenance and refuge .
