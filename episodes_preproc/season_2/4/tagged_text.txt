<entity class="NE" id=2670>Tyrion</entity> attempts to restrain <entity class="NE" id=2671>Joffrey</entity> 's cruelty . <entity class="NE" id=2672>Catelyn</entity> attempts to broker a peace between <entity class="NE" id=2673>Stannis</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2674>Renly</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2675>Daenerys</entity> and her followers arrive at the great city of <entity class="NE" id=2676>Qarth</entity> and hope to find refuge there . <entity class="NE" id=2677>Arya</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2678>Gendry</entity> arrive at <entity class="NE" id=2679>Harrenhal</entity> , a great castle now under <entity class="NE" id=2680>Lannister</entity> occupation . In the <entity class="NE" id=2681>Seven Kingdoms</entity> . A <entity class="NE" id=2682>Silent Sister</entity> working on a casualty at <entity class="NE" id=2683>Oxcross</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=2684>Northern</entity> army under King <entity class="NE" id=2685>Robb Stark</entity> leads a surprise night-time assault against an encamped Lannister army , which was only manned by <entity class="NE" id=2686>Rennick</entity> and another Lannister guardsman ( <entity class="NE" id=2687>Garden</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=2688>Bones</entity> ) , with his direwolf <entity class="NE" id=2689>Grey Wind</entity> causing a considerable amount of damage . The <entity class="NE" id=2690>Battle</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=2691>Oxcross</entity> is a smashing victory , following through on <entity class="NE" id=2692>Robb</entity> 's promise to give <entity class="NE" id=2693>Cersei</entity> `` another Whispering Wood . '' [ 2 ] The next day <entity class="NE" id=2694>Robb</entity> surveys the battlefield as <entity class="NE" id=2695>Silent Sisters</entity> tend to both <entity class="NE" id=2696>Stark</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2697>Lannister</entity> wounded , while his bannerman , <entity class="NE" id=2698>Lord Roose Bolton</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=2699>Dreadfort</entity> , argues that they should kill all of the <entity class="NE" id=2697>Lannister</entity> soldiers they took prisoner , because they 're having trouble supplying their own army and prisoners will slow them down . <entity class="NE" id=2700>Robb</entity> disagrees , saying they will fight honorably and follow the laws of war . <entity class="NE" id=2701>Bolton</entity> concedes that some of the Lannister officers might have useful information they could be tortured into revealing , but <entity class="NE" id=2702>Robb</entity> refuses , not wanting to give the <entity class="NE" id=2703>Lannisters</entity> an excuse to torture his sisters , <entity class="NE" id=2704>Sansa</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2705>Arya</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2706>Robb</entity> sees a woman battlefield healer treating a wounded Lannister soldier . The prisoner protests when she tells him she has to amputate in order to save his life . <entity class="NE" id=2707>Robb</entity> helps hold him down as she saws off the leg . The woman , who introduces herself as <entity class="NE" id=2708>Talisa</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=2709>Volantis</entity> , criticizes <entity class="NE" id=2710>Robb</entity> for the need for this war . <entity class="NE" id=2711>Robb</entity> does n't want the <entity class="NE" id=2712>Iron Throne</entity> , just revenge on <entity class="NE" id=2713>Joffrey</entity> for his father 's death . She is shocked to learn he does n't care which king takes the throne after they defeat <entity class="NE" id=2714>Joffrey</entity> ( having declared for neither of the <entity class="NE" id=2715>Baratheon</entity> brothers ) . He just wants them to leave the north alone afterward . She points out that for all the bloodshed they have caused , he has n't hurt the ones who killed his father , <entity class="NE" id=2716>Joffrey</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2717>Tywin Lannister</entity> . The men they slaughtered were not <entity class="NE" id=2718>Tywin</entity> 's main army but unwilling boy soldiers and conscripts from the <entity class="NE" id=2719>Westerlands</entity> . The prisoners arrive at <entity class="NE" id=2720>Harrenhal</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2721>Arya Arya</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2722>Gendry</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=2723>Hot Pie</entity> are taken by <entity class="NE" id=2724>Ser Amory Lorch</entity> 's group of soldiers to <entity class="NE" id=2725>Harrenhal</entity> , a vast but partially ruined castle which was badly damaged during the <entity class="NE" id=2726>Targaryen Conquest</entity> three hundred years ago by dragons ' fire . <entity class="NE" id=2727>Arya</entity> 's group is herded in with many other prisoners the <entity class="NE" id=2728>Lannister</entity> soldiers have taken , primarily peasant refugees from the <entity class="NE" id=2729>Riverlands</entity> . The commander of the entire Lannister force is <entity class="NE" id=2730>Ser Gregor Clegane</entity> , `` the Mountain That <entity class="NE" id=2731>Rides</entity> , '' previously declared an outlaw by <entity class="NE" id=2732>Eddard Stark</entity> for his raiding in the <entity class="NE" id=2733>Riverlands</entity> . Now the positions are reversed , with <entity class="NE" id=2734>Clegane</entity> having the support of the <entity class="NE" id=2735>Iron Throne</entity> to brutalize the <entity class="NE" id=2736>Rivermen</entity> . The stench of corpses is so strong that <entity class="NE" id=2737>Arya</entity> notices it as soon as they are in sight of the castle . The <entity class="NE" id=2738>Lannister</entity> soldiers under <entity class="NE" id=2739>Ser Gregor</entity> - particularly one known as The Ticklerâ€“sadistically torture many of the prisoners they have taken . One method used is to tie a bucket containing a rat to a man 's abdomen , and then to hold a flame to the back of the bucket so the rat will chew its way through the man 's guts . The prisoners are for the most part simple peasant refugees with no knowledge of the war , and the <entity class="NE" id=2740>Lannister</entity> soldiers are savagely torturing them just because they want to know where they may have hid the few valuables they have . However , some are also asked if they know anything about a group known as `` The <entity class="NE" id=2741>Brotherhood</entity> . '' Just as <entity class="NE" id=2742>Gendry</entity> is about to be tortured , <entity class="NE" id=2743>Lord Tywin Lannister</entity> arrives with the main host of his army , who have retreated to <entity class="NE" id=2744>Harrenhal</entity> to regroup after their loss at the <entity class="NE" id=2745>Battle</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=2746>Whispering Wood</entity> . The main Lannister army group led by <entity class="NE" id=2747>Lord Tywin</entity> is settling in to use <entity class="NE" id=2748>Harrenhal</entity> as their new main base for the ongoing campaign in the <entity class="NE" id=2749>Riverlands</entity> . `` Leave her face , I like her pretty . `` . <entity class="NE" id=2750>Tywin</entity> orders an immediate halt to the tortures ( saving <entity class="NE" id=2751>Gendry</entity> ) , rationally pointing out how disproportionate it is relative to what little wealth the peasants might be hiding , and it would be far more efficient to put them to work around the castle . As a blacksmith 's apprentice , <entity class="NE" id=2752>Gendry</entity> 's skills are of particular use to them , and he is set to work . <entity class="NE" id=2753>Tywin</entity> instantly notices that `` <entity class="NE" id=2754>Arry</entity> '' is really a girl dressed up in boy 's clothing , criticizing his soldiers for being too foolish to notice . When he asks her why she 's dressed as a boy , <entity class="NE" id=2755>Arya</entity> simply explains that it was safer . <entity class="NE" id=2756>Tywin</entity> is impressed with her intelligence , and takes her on as his new cupbearer while his army is based at the castle . In <entity class="NE" id=2757>King</entity> 's Landing , King <entity class="NE" id=2758>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> is furious when he hears of <entity class="NE" id=2759>Robb Stark</entity> 's decisive victory against Lannister forces . He has <entity class="NE" id=2760>Sansa Stark</entity> brought before the assembled court in the recently redecorated throne room , which now boasts iron spikes on many surfaces and roaring fires surrounding the pillars . <entity class="NE" id=2761>Lancel Lancel</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=2762>Sansa</entity> and the assembled nobles that <entity class="NE" id=2763>Robb</entity> only won the battle with trickery and sorcery . At first , <entity class="NE" id=2764>Joffrey</entity> sadistically menaces <entity class="NE" id=2765>Sansa</entity> by brandishing a crossbow at her and openly toying with the thought of killing her right in front of the throne to send her brother a message . Despite being clearly terrified , <entity class="NE" id=2766>Sansa</entity> refuses to give Joffrey the satisfaction of scaring her and continues to firmly pledge her loyalty . <entity class="NE" id=2767>Annoyed</entity> , he reluctantly concedes to his mother 's insistence that they need <entity class="NE" id=2768>Sansa</entity> alive , lowering the crossbow and ordering her to stand . <entity class="NE" id=2769>Sansa</entity> , beaten and stripped in front of the entire court . <entity class="NE" id=2770>Joffrey</entity> then sits down on the <entity class="NE" id=2771>Iron Throne</entity> and commands <entity class="NE" id=2772>Ser Meryn Trant</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=2773>Kingsguard</entity> to beat and strip her as punishment , but instructs <entity class="NE" id=2774>Trant</entity> to leave her face because `` I like her pretty . '' Ser Ser punches <entity class="NE" id=2775>Sansa</entity> violently in the stomach and strikes her in the back of the legs with the flat of his sword , causing her to fall down . He then rips open the back of her gown , leaving her partially naked from the waist up . As the beating continues , the entire court watches in horror , particularly a disgusted <entity class="NE" id=2776>Sandor Clegane</entity> . But despite being filled with dozens of knights and officials , no one intervenes out of fear of <entity class="NE" id=2777>Joffrey</entity> 's wrath . A furious Tyrion Lannister marches in and puts a stop to the spectacle . He orders someone to cover <entity class="NE" id=2778>Sansa</entity> up and <entity class="NE" id=2779>Sandor</entity> immediately steps forward , taking off his cloak and proceeds to gently wrap it around her . <entity class="NE" id=2780>Tyrion</entity> turns his wrath upon <entity class="NE" id=2781>Joffrey</entity> , berating his actions as <entity class="NE" id=2782>Sansa</entity> is his future wife and queen that he is publicly shaming ( and the fact that <entity class="NE" id=2781>Joffrey</entity> does n't pause to think how politically disastrous it would be for their allies to see him having his guards beat a valuable political hostage to a bloody pulp ) . <entity class="NE" id=2783>Furious</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2784>Joffrey</entity> proclaims that he was punishing her . Denouncing his nephew as a `` halfwit , '' Tyrion points out the absurdity of punishing <entity class="NE" id=2785>Sansa</entity> for her brother 's actions miles away in a war that <entity class="NE" id=2786>Joffrey</entity> himself started . Now completely enraged , <entity class="NE" id=2787>Joffrey</entity> bellows that as king , he can do whatever he pleases , but <entity class="NE" id=2788>Tyrion</entity> again coldly counters that the <entity class="NE" id=2789>Mad King</entity> thought he could do as he pleased too , which led to him being overthrown and killed . <entity class="NE" id=2790>Joffrey</entity> torments <entity class="NE" id=2791>Ros</entity> to send a message to <entity class="NE" id=2792>Tyrion</entity> . When <entity class="NE" id=2793>Ser Meryn</entity> tries to support the king , <entity class="NE" id=2794>Tyrion</entity> silences the <entity class="NE" id=2795>Kingsguard</entity> by ordering <entity class="NE" id=2796>Bronn</entity> to kill <entity class="NE" id=2797>Meryn</entity> if the knight opens his mouth again . <entity class="NE" id=2798>Tyrion</entity> comforts the shaken <entity class="NE" id=2799>Sansa</entity> and personally escorts her out of the hall . He asks her whether she wants to end her engagement to the king , but she continues to parrot the lines that she loves <entity class="NE" id=2800>Joffrey</entity> and will uphold her duty . Impressed , <entity class="NE" id=2801>Tyrion</entity> remarks that she has learned how to survive around <entity class="NE" id=2802>Joffrey</entity> and might just make it out of her situation alive , respectfully calling her `` <entity class="NE" id=2803>Lady Stark</entity> . `` . <entity class="NE" id=2804>Bronn</entity> suggests to Tyrion that as an angry young man , maybe what <entity class="NE" id=2805>Joffrey</entity> needs is to have sex with a woman , and that they should set him up with a prostitute . <entity class="NE" id=2806>Tyrion</entity> agrees that maybe this would give <entity class="NE" id=2807>Joffrey</entity> a chance to release his frustrations away from <entity class="NE" id=2808>Sansa</entity> . Indeed , he might even be grateful for the gesture : given that he did n't have much of a father figure in <entity class="NE" id=2809>Robert Baratheon</entity> to set him straight , doing something nice for the boy might even be the second chance <entity class="NE" id=2810>Joffrey</entity> needs to re-establish a relationship with a male family figure . So Tyrion arranges for two prostitutes from <entity class="NE" id=2811>Littlefinger</entity> 's brothel , <entity class="NE" id=2812>Ros</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2813>Daisy</entity> , to entertain <entity class="NE" id=2814>Joffrey</entity> . Unfortunately , the attempt fails horrifically : instead of trying to have sex with the prostitutes , <entity class="NE" id=2815>Joffrey</entity> brings a loaded crossbow into the bedchamber . At crossbow-point , <entity class="NE" id=2816>Joffrey</entity> forces <entity class="NE" id=2817>Ros</entity> to beat <entity class="NE" id=2818>Daisy</entity> unconscious , and then to dump her body in <entity class="NE" id=2819>Tyrion</entity> 's chambers , to send his uncle a message warning him not to interfere with his handling of <entity class="NE" id=2820>Sansa</entity> again . As <entity class="NE" id=2821>Tyrion</entity> works in his chamber late at night , his cousin <entity class="NE" id=2822>Lancel Lannister</entity> knocks on his door delivering orders from <entity class="NE" id=2823>Cersei</entity> to release <entity class="NE" id=2824>Grand Maester Pycelle</entity> from the dungeon at once . Despite their blood relationship <entity class="NE" id=2825>Lancel</entity> clearly holds Tyrion in contempt and openly calls him `` Imp . '' <entity class="NE" id=2826>Curious</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2827>Tyrion</entity> asks why <entity class="NE" id=2828>Lancel</entity> is so late delivering the message . Blundering into a rather obvious trap , <entity class="NE" id=2829>Lancel</entity> retorts that he always delivers messages immediately and is never late . <entity class="NE" id=2830>Tyrion</entity> then simply points out how odd it is that <entity class="NE" id=2831>Lancel</entity> would be coming from <entity class="NE" id=2832>Cersei</entity> 's bedchambers in the middle of the night . <entity class="NE" id=2833>Lancel</entity> nervously says <entity class="NE" id=2834>Cersei</entity> often works tirelessly keeping late hours , but <entity class="NE" id=2835>Tyrion</entity> also notices that he reeks of <entity class="NE" id=2834>Cersei</entity> 's favorite lavender oil perfume . <entity class="NE" id=2836>Tyrion</entity> enquires whether <entity class="NE" id=2837>Lancel</entity> was made a knight before or after he started sharing <entity class="NE" id=2838>Cersei</entity> 's bed . <entity class="NE" id=2839>Lancel</entity> falls apart , saying that <entity class="NE" id=2840>Cersei</entity> 's father ordered him to obey her every command when he became a squire to King <entity class="NE" id=2841>Robert</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2842>Tyrion</entity> sarcastically asks if <entity class="NE" id=2843>Cersei</entity> forced him to have sex with her too . <entity class="NE" id=2844>Tyrion</entity> wonders aloud what <entity class="NE" id=2845>Joffrey</entity> would do if he found out that <entity class="NE" id=2846>Lancel</entity> had not only killed <entity class="NE" id=2845>Joffrey</entity> 's father but was also sleeping with his mother . <entity class="NE" id=2847>Lancel</entity> gets down on his knees and pleads for his life . <entity class="NE" id=2848>Tyrion</entity> gently instructs <entity class="NE" id=2849>Lancel</entity> that he wo n't tell , but from now on , <entity class="NE" id=2849>Lancel</entity> must report everything <entity class="NE" id=2850>Cersei</entity> does back to <entity class="NE" id=2848>Tyrion</entity> . As <entity class="NE" id=2851>Lancel</entity> leaves , he also casually agrees that he will accede to <entity class="NE" id=2852>Cersei</entity> 's request and free Pycelle if she wants him as a `` pet '' , though he does n't want him back on the <entity class="NE" id=2853>Small Council</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2854>Petyr</entity> `` Littlefinger '' <entity class="NE" id=2855>Baelish</entity> arrives at <entity class="NE" id=2856>King Renly Baratheon</entity> 's camp as a political envoy from King <entity class="NE" id=2857>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> at <entity class="NE" id=2858>King</entity> 's Landing . He tries to gain <entity class="NE" id=2859>Renly</entity> 's trust by implying that if <entity class="NE" id=2859>Renly</entity> does march on the capital , he will help take down the Lannisters from within ( it is unclear if he is lying , but he is also ready to jump ship if the <entity class="NE" id=2860>Lannisters</entity> lose , and <entity class="NE" id=2861>Stannis</entity> is not an option , because <entity class="NE" id=2861>Stannis</entity> despises Littlefinger ) ; <entity class="NE" id=2859>Renly</entity> is tempted by the notion , despite his dislike for Littlefinger . Littlefinger then has a conversation with <entity class="NE" id=2862>Queen Margaery Tyrell</entity> in which he tries to intimidate her by hinting that her husband is homosexual . He does not anticipate that <entity class="NE" id=2863>Margaery</entity> seems to already know and not to care . <entity class="NE" id=2864>Margaery</entity> is not a naive ingenue like <entity class="NE" id=2865>Sansa Stark</entity> but versed in court strategies : she honestly believes that <entity class="NE" id=2866>Renly</entity> is the best candidate for king , and voluntarily entered into a paper marriage to secure the political alliance between <entity class="NE" id=2866>Renly</entity> and <entity class="HSE" id=2867>House Tyrell</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2868>Baelish</entity> then meets with <entity class="NE" id=2869>Catelyn Stark</entity> , who is still furious at his betrayal of her husband to his death . <entity class="NE" id=2870>Baelish</entity> first tries to kindle a romance with her , saying that now they are both free , it may be that they can be together . <entity class="NE" id=2871>Catelyn</entity> simply draws a dagger and demands that he stop speaking . <entity class="NE" id=2872>Discouraged</entity> , he moves on to present <entity class="NE" id=2873>Tyrion</entity> 's offer that the <entity class="NE" id=2874>Lannisters</entity> want to make a prisoner exchange with the Starks : if they release <entity class="NE" id=2875>Jaime Lannister</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2876>Queen Cersei</entity> will release both <entity class="NE" id=2877>Sansa Stark</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2878>Arya Stark</entity> ( <entity class="NE" id=2879>Baelish</entity> lies about the <entity class="NE" id=2874>Lannisters</entity> having <entity class="NE" id=2880>Arya</entity> ) . <entity class="NE" id=2881>Catelyn</entity> insists that <entity class="NE" id=2882>Robb</entity> would never allow the exchange , but <entity class="NE" id=2883>Littlefinger</entity> tries to manipulate her love for her imprisoned daughters . As a show of good faith from <entity class="NE" id=2884>Tyrion</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2885>Baelish</entity> brings forward a pair of <entity class="NE" id=2886>Silent Sisters</entity> carrying a box containing the remains of <entity class="NE" id=2887>Ned Stark</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2888>Deeply</entity> grieving , <entity class="NE" id=2889>Catelyn</entity> tells <entity class="NE" id=2890>Petyr</entity> to get out . She looks at the bones with pain , but then shuts the box with a look of resolve on her face . The shadow wrenches itself free from <entity class="NE" id=2891>Melisandre</entity> 's womb . King <entity class="NE" id=2892>Stannis Baratheon</entity> then arrives at <entity class="NE" id=2893>Renly</entity> 's camp , along with the <entity class="NE" id=2894>Red Priestess Melisandre</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2895>Ser Davos Seaworth</entity> in his retinue . <entity class="NE" id=2896>Stannis</entity> has come to treat with <entity class="NE" id=2897>Renly</entity> and give him the chance to willingly relinquish his claim and serve his older brother . Renly , along with his <entity class="NE" id=2898>Kingsguard</entity> members <entity class="NE" id=2899>Brienne</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=2900>Ser Loras Tyrell</entity> , counters that no one wants <entity class="NE" id=2901>Stannis</entity> to be king . <entity class="NE" id=2902>Renly</entity> also scoffs at <entity class="NE" id=2903>Stannis</entity> ' conversion to the religion of the <entity class="NE" id=2904>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=2905>Light</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2906>Catelyn Catelyn</entity> criticizes both brothers for acting like sulking children . <entity class="NE" id=2907>Stannis</entity> counters that it is odd that <entity class="NE" id=2908>Catelyn</entity> is standing alongside Renly , given that her own husband <entity class="NE" id=2909>Ned Stark</entity> rejected <entity class="NE" id=2910>Renly</entity> 's initial plan to claim the throne and supported <entity class="NE" id=2907>Stannis</entity> as <entity class="NE" id=2911>Robert</entity> 's rightful heir , even at the cost of his own life . In a display of leniency that is uncharacteristic for him , <entity class="NE" id=2912>Stannis</entity> offers Renly that if he relinquishes his claim , <entity class="NE" id=2912>Stannis</entity> will grant him his old seat on the small council , and even name him as his heir ( unless <entity class="NE" id=2912>Stannis</entity> ever has a son in the future ) . <entity class="NE" id=2913>Catelyn</entity> reminds <entity class="NE" id=2914>Stannis</entity> that their common enemy is the <entity class="NE" id=2915>Lannisters</entity> , but he will not hear it , again asserting his right to the <entity class="NE" id=2916>Iron Throne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=2917>Renly</entity> states that the 100,000 soldiers waving his banners makes him king , and <entity class="NE" id=2918>Stannis</entity> ' small army is hopelessly outnumbered . <entity class="NE" id=2919>Stannis</entity> says that they shall see the next morning when their armies clash , and he departs . As she leaves <entity class="NE" id=2920>Melisandre</entity> warns , `` Look to your sins <entity class="NE" id=2921>Lord Renly</entity> , for the night is dark and full of terrors . '' Renly watches his brother fade into the distance and asks his companions if they can believe that he loved <entity class="NE" id=2922>Stannis</entity> once . At <entity class="NE" id=2923>King Stannis</entity> ' command , <entity class="NE" id=2924>Ser Davos</entity> rows <entity class="NE" id=2925>Melisandre</entity> to some caves located near <entity class="NE" id=2926>Renly</entity> 's camp . <entity class="NE" id=2927>Davos</entity> knows these caves from his old smuggling days . <entity class="NE" id=2928>Melisandre</entity> asks him about whether he desires her , and his views on the conflict they are involved in between right and wrong , insisting that she is on the side of good . They find the way through the caves is blocked by metal bars . <entity class="NE" id=2929>Melisandre</entity> takes off her cloak revealing that she is naked and heavily pregnant and promptly `` gives birth '' to a creature made entirely of shadow , as <entity class="NE" id=2930>Ser Davos</entity> looks on in horror . Across the <entity class="NE" id=2931>Narrow Sea</entity> . The main gate of <entity class="NE" id=2932>Qarth</entity> opens for <entity class="NE" id=2933>Daenerys</entity> . On the return of her bloodrider <entity class="NE" id=2934>Kovarro</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=2935>Daenerys</entity> receives word that the city of <entity class="NE" id=2936>Qarth</entity> is nearby , and they are willing to receive the `` Mother of <entity class="NE" id=2937>Dragons</entity> .
