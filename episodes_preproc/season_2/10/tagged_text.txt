She finds herself in an empty circular room with many doors . She chooses one and opens it . She is presented with tempting visions . First the snowy , ruined throne room of <entity class="NE" id=3646>King</entity> 's Landing where she turns away from the <entity class="NE" id=3697>Iron Throne</entity> . She then walks through the gates of the <entity class="NE" id=3678>Wall</entity> surrounded by more snow , and into <entity class="NE" id=3704>Drogo</entity> 's tent . She finds <entity class="NE" id=3704>Drogo</entity> and what would have been her infant son <entity class="NE" id=3706>Rhaego</entity> . They talk about whose dream they are in , and <entity class="NE" id=3696>Daenerys</entity> silently leaves after touching <entity class="NE" id=3706>Rhaego</entity> 's hair . She returns to the room with many doors and finds her dragons chained to a pedestal in front of her . <entity class="NE" id=3709>Pyat Pree</entity> appears and explains that she and her brood are the source of his restored magic . <entity class="NE" id=3696>Daenerys</entity> is also chained by <entity class="NE" id=3711>Pyat</entity> 's magic . The young queen is unconcerned however , and simply regards Pree with a cool , almost lazy gaze . She calmly utters a single word : '' Dracarys '' ; after a couple of tries , all three dragons unleash their fiery breath , and <entity class="NE" id=3709>Pyat Pree</entity> is incinerated . <entity class="NE" id=3696>Daenerys</entity> knows that <entity class="NE" id=3714>Xaro</entity> has betrayed her . She returns to his palace to confront him and finds <entity class="NE" id=3715>Doreah</entity> in bed with him . She takes his key and uses it to open his <entity class="NE" id=3716>Valyrian</entity> stone vault . She is surprised when it is empty , but observes that this proves something can easily come from nothing . On her orders , <entity class="NE" id=3715>Doreah</entity> and Xaro are locked into the empty vault to die , their pleas cut off by the closing door . <entity class="NE" id=3696>Daenerys</entity> salvages enough from <entity class="NE" id=3714>Xaro</entity> 's household to buy a ship . On <entity class="NE" id=3699>Jorah</entity> 's orders , the <entity class="NE" id=3721>Dothraki</entity> seize <entity class="NE" id=3714>Xaro</entity> 's gold and jewels while <entity class="NE" id=3696>Daenerys</entity> triumphantly watches with her three dragons . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=3678>Wall</entity> . The King-Beyond-the-Wall 's <entity class="NE" id=3725>Camp</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3726>Jon Jon</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3727>Qhorin Halfhand</entity> are marched towards the camp of the King-Beyond-the-Wall , <entity class="NE" id=3728>Mance Rayder</entity> , as captives of the <entity class="NE" id=3623>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=3730>Bones</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3581>Qhorin</entity> realizes that he will have to sacrifice himself in order to facilitate the ruse of Jon deserting to the wildlings , so he stuns one of his captors and acquires a sword , attacking <entity class="NE" id=3580>Jon</entity> with the seeming intention of killing him for treachery . The <entity class="NE" id=3623>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=3730>Bones</entity> lets them fight , and <entity class="NE" id=3735>Ygritte</entity> gives <entity class="NE" id=3580>Jon</entity> back his sword . <entity class="NE" id=3581>Qhorin</entity> enrages Jon by insulting his parentage . After a fierce duel , <entity class="NE" id=3580>Jon</entity> mortally wounds <entity class="NE" id=3581>Qhorin</entity> per <entity class="NE" id=3581>Qhorin</entity> 's own instructions , who whispers to Jon `` We are the watchers on the <entity class="NE" id=3678>Wall</entity> '' before he breathes his last , signalling to him that he has done the right thing and reminding <entity class="NE" id=3580>Jon</entity> that he must find out all he can about the wildlings ' plans and get back to the <entity class="NE" id=3678>Wall</entity> . By killing <entity class="NE" id=3581>Qhorin</entity> , the wildlings believe <entity class="NE" id=3580>Jon</entity> has betrayed his oath and release him . Impressed , the <entity class="NE" id=3623>Lord</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=3730>Bones</entity> cuts <entity class="NE" id=3580>Jon</entity> free . <entity class="NE" id=3735>Ygritte</entity> shows him their vast army , gathering in a valley below . She promises to take him to their King and , with no other choice , <entity class="NE" id=3580>Jon</entity> follows her . At the <entity class="NE" id=3748>Fist</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3749>First Men</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3750>Sam</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3751>Grenn</entity> and Edd are foraging for fuel when they hear three horn blasts ; the warning call for <entity class="NE" id=3752>White Walkers</entity> . The three run back to the <entity class="NE" id=3748>Fist</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3750>Sam</entity> is left behind , caught in a sudden blizzard . Seeing shadowy figures moving through the blowing snow , <entity class="NE" id=3750>Sam</entity> hides behind a rock and watches as dozens of <entity class="NE" id=3756>Wights</entity> walk past him , led by a <entity class="NE" id=3757>White Walker</entity> riding an undead horse-wight . <entity class="NE" id=3750>Sam</entity> cowers in fear , but the <entity class="NE" id=3757>White Walker</entity> seemingly ignores him . Raising a spear with a blade of ice , the creature gives a piercing shriek , and the army of wights and <entity class="NE" id=3752>White Walkers</entity> , numbering several hundred , advances on the <entity class="NE" id=3748>Fist</entity> .
