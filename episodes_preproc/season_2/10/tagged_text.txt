She finds herself in an empty circular room with many doors . She chooses one and opens it . She is presented with tempting visions . First the snowy , ruined throne room of <entity id=3727>King</entity> 's Landing where she turns away from the <entity id=3728>Iron Throne</entity> . She then walks through the gates of the <entity id=3729>Wall</entity> surrounded by more snow , and into <entity id=3730>Drogo</entity> 's tent . She finds <entity id=3731>Drogo</entity> and what would have been her infant son <entity id=3732>Rhaego</entity> . They talk about whose dream they are in , and <entity id=3733>Daenerys</entity> silently leaves after touching <entity id=3734>Rhaego</entity> 's hair . She returns to the room with many doors and finds her dragons chained to a pedestal in front of her . <entity id=3735>Pyat Pree</entity> appears and explains that she and her brood are the source of his restored magic . <entity id=3736>Daenerys</entity> is also chained by <entity id=3737>Pyat</entity> 's magic . The young queen is unconcerned however , and simply regards Pree with a cool , almost lazy gaze . She calmly utters a single word : '' Dracarys '' ; after a couple of tries , all three dragons unleash their fiery breath , and <entity id=3738>Pyat Pree</entity> is incinerated . <entity id=3739>Daenerys</entity> knows that <entity id=3740>Xaro</entity> has betrayed her . She returns to his palace to confront him and finds <entity id=3741>Doreah</entity> in bed with him . She takes his key and uses it to open his <entity id=3742>Valyrian</entity> stone vault . She is surprised when it is empty , but observes that this proves something can easily come from nothing . On her orders , <entity id=3743>Doreah</entity> and Xaro are locked into the empty vault to die , their pleas cut off by the closing door . <entity id=3744>Daenerys</entity> salvages enough from <entity id=3745>Xaro</entity> 's household to buy a ship . On <entity id=3746>Jorah</entity> 's orders , the <entity id=3747>Dothraki</entity> seize <entity id=3748>Xaro</entity> 's gold and jewels while <entity id=3749>Daenerys</entity> triumphantly watches with her three dragons . Beyond the <entity id=3750>Wall</entity> . The King-Beyond-the-Wall 's <entity id=3751>Camp</entity> . <entity id=3752>Jon Jon</entity> and <entity id=3753>Qhorin Halfhand</entity> are marched towards the camp of the King-Beyond-the-Wall , <entity id=3754>Mance Rayder</entity> , as captives of the <entity id=3755>Lord</entity> of <entity id=3756>Bones</entity> . <entity id=3757>Qhorin</entity> realizes that he will have to sacrifice himself in order to facilitate the ruse of Jon deserting to the wildlings , so he stuns one of his captors and acquires a sword , attacking <entity id=3758>Jon</entity> with the seeming intention of killing him for treachery . The <entity id=3759>Lord</entity> of <entity id=3760>Bones</entity> lets them fight , and <entity id=3761>Ygritte</entity> gives <entity id=3762>Jon</entity> back his sword . <entity id=3763>Qhorin</entity> enrages Jon by insulting his parentage . After a fierce duel , <entity id=3764>Jon</entity> mortally wounds <entity id=3765>Qhorin</entity> per <entity id=3765>Qhorin</entity> 's own instructions , who whispers to Jon `` We are the watchers on the <entity id=3766>Wall</entity> '' before he breathes his last , signalling to him that he has done the right thing and reminding <entity id=3764>Jon</entity> that he must find out all he can about the wildlings ' plans and get back to the <entity id=3766>Wall</entity> . By killing <entity id=3767>Qhorin</entity> , the wildlings believe <entity id=3768>Jon</entity> has betrayed his oath and release him . Impressed , the <entity id=3769>Lord</entity> of <entity id=3770>Bones</entity> cuts <entity id=3771>Jon</entity> free . <entity id=3772>Ygritte</entity> shows him their vast army , gathering in a valley below . She promises to take him to their King and , with no other choice , <entity id=3773>Jon</entity> follows her . At the <entity id=3774>Fist</entity> of the <entity id=3775>First Men</entity> , <entity id=3776>Sam</entity> , <entity id=3777>Grenn</entity> and Edd are foraging for fuel when they hear three horn blasts ; the warning call for <entity id=3778>White Walkers</entity> . The three run back to the <entity id=3779>Fist</entity> . <entity id=3780>Sam</entity> is left behind , caught in a sudden blizzard . Seeing shadowy figures moving through the blowing snow , <entity id=3781>Sam</entity> hides behind a rock and watches as dozens of <entity id=3782>Wights</entity> walk past him , led by a <entity id=3783>White Walker</entity> riding an undead horse-wight . <entity id=3784>Sam</entity> cowers in fear , but the <entity id=3785>White Walker</entity> seemingly ignores him . Raising a spear with a blade of ice , the creature gives a piercing shriek , and the army of wights and <entity id=3786>White Walkers</entity> , numbering several hundred , advances on the <entity id=3787>Fist</entity> .
