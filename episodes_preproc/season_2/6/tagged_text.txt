He spits in <entity class="NE" id=3098>Theon</entity> 's face , and <entity class="NE" id=3099>Dagmer Cleftjaw</entity> insists that Theon must kill him , or lose face in front of his ironborn raiders . <entity class="NE" id=3100>Theon</entity> botches the beheading of <entity class="NE" id=3101>Ser Rodrik</entity> , requiring several hacks and a kick , horrifying the people of <entity class="NE" id=3102>Winterfell</entity> .

In the <entity class="NE" id=3111>Westerlands</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=3112>King Robb Stark</entity> 's army camp , <entity class="NE" id=3113>Robb</entity> chats with <entity class="NE" id=3114>Talisa</entity> , who has followed his forces on their campaign . <entity class="NE" id=3115>Robb</entity> introduces <entity class="NE" id=3116>Talisa</entity> to his mother <entity class="NE" id=3117>Catelyn Stark</entity> , who has returned from the Stormlands along with <entity class="NE" id=3118>Brienne</entity> of <entity class="NE" id=3119>Tarth</entity> . They are interrupted when <entity class="NE" id=3120>Lord Roose Bolton</entity> arrives with the terrible news sent by <entity class="NE" id=3121>Luwin</entity> 's last messenger raven . Furious at <entity class="NE" id=3122>Theon</entity> 's betrayal , <entity class="NE" id=3123>Robb</entity> intends to march his army back to the <entity class="NE" id=3124>North</entity> to repel the invasion . <entity class="NE" id=3125>Roose</entity> advises that the few hundred soldiers left scattered in the <entity class="NE" id=3126>North</entity> can be rallied by his bastard son , <entity class="NE" id=3127>Ramsay Snow</entity> , who is in the <entity class="NE" id=3126>North</entity> at the <entity class="NE" id=3128>Dreadfort</entity> . They could overcome the small Ironborn invasion force . <entity class="NE" id=3129>Roose</entity> warns that retreating the entire <entity class="NE" id=3130>Northern</entity> army group would lose everything they have gained . <entity class="NE" id=3131>Robb</entity> agrees , but insists that <entity class="NE" id=3132>Bolton</entity> 's men take Theon alive so <entity class="NE" id=3131>Robb</entity> can look him in the eyes and ask `` Why ? '' before personally executing him . In the <entity class="NE" id=3133>Riverlands</entity> . At <entity class="NE" id=3134>Harrenhal</entity> , the main base camp for the <entity class="HSE" id=3135>House Lannister</entity> army in the <entity class="NE" id=3136>Riverlands</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3137>Tywin Lannister</entity> berates <entity class="NE" id=3138>Ser Amory Lorch</entity> for delivering a letter to their enemies instead of their allies , because he can not read properly . He discovers that his cupbearer `` <entity class="NE" id=3139>Arry</entity> '' ( secretly <entity class="NE" id=3140>Arya Stark</entity> ) can read . <entity class="NE" id=3141>Joffrey</entity> has excrement thrown on him by rioting peasants . <entity class="NE" id=3142>Petyr</entity> `` Littlefinger '' <entity class="NE" id=3143>Baelish</entity> arrives at camp and meets with <entity class="NE" id=3144>Tywin</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3145>Arya</entity> tries to hide her face to prevent Littlefinger from identifying her . <entity class="NE" id=3146>Baelish</entity> discusses the assassination of <entity class="NE" id=3147>Renly Baratheon</entity> , and the subsequent rallying of the noble Houses from the Stormlands under the banner of his older brother <entity class="NE" id=3148>Stannis Baratheon</entity> . However , <entity class="HSE" id=3149>House Tyrell</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3150>Reach</entity> has retreated its large army back to their capital at <entity class="NE" id=3151>Highgarden</entity> , and has not joined <entity class="NE" id=3152>Stannis</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3153>Baelish</entity> discusses with <entity class="NE" id=3154>Tywin</entity> the possibility of forming an alliance between <entity class="HSE" id=3155>House Lannister</entity> and <entity class="HSE" id=3156>House Tyrell</entity> . Later Tywin questions Arya about her origins . While <entity class="NE" id=3157>Tywin</entity> is distracted , <entity class="NE" id=3158>Arya</entity> sees that a letter on his table is about her older brother <entity class="NE" id=3159>Robb Stark</entity> , so she snatches it . After asking <entity class="NE" id=3160>Tywin</entity> about his own father , <entity class="NE" id=3160>Tywin</entity> sends her to fetch more firewood . She takes this opportunity to read the letter , but unfortunately bumps into <entity class="NE" id=3161>Amory Lorch</entity> who sees that she is carrying the letter and grows suspicious . <entity class="NE" id=3162>Arya</entity> runs away and <entity class="NE" id=3163>Amory</entity> heads to tell <entity class="NE" id=3164>Tywin</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3165>Arya</entity> runs to find <entity class="NE" id=3166>Jaqen H'ghar</entity> , telling him that <entity class="NE" id=3167>Amory Lorch</entity> is the second name he owes her . Just as <entity class="NE" id=3168>Amory Lorch</entity> reaches <entity class="NE" id=3169>Tywin</entity> 's quarters , he falls down dead with a poisoned dart lodged in his neck . In <entity class="NE" id=3170>King</entity> 's Landing . The royal court including King <entity class="NE" id=3171>Joffrey Baratheon</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3172>Queen Regent Cersei Lannister</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3173>Prince Tommen Baratheon</entity> , and <entity class="NE" id=3174>Sansa Stark</entity> are at the docks seeing off <entity class="NE" id=3175>Princess Myrcella Baratheon</entity> as she departs in a ship bound for <entity class="NE" id=3176>Dorne</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3177>Cersei</entity> is heartbroken and warns Tyrion that she will not forgive him for sending away her only daughter . As per <entity class="NE" id=3178>Tyrion</entity> 's plans , <entity class="NE" id=3179>Myrcella</entity> will stay in <entity class="NE" id=3180>Dorne</entity> with <entity class="HSE" id=3181>House Martell</entity> until she comes of age to fulfill the marriage alliance to their youngest son , <entity class="NE" id=3182>Trystane Martell</entity> . The <entity class="NE" id=3183>High Septon</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3184>Faith</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3185>Seven</entity> offers a blessing for her departure . The streets of the capital city are overflowing with starving refugees from the War of the <entity class="NE" id=3186>Five Kings</entity> , as <entity class="NE" id=3187>Cersei</entity> ignored both Tyrion and <entity class="NE" id=3188>Janos Slynt</entity> 's earlier warnings that something had to be done to care for the starving peasants or there would be mounting discontent with her son 's rule . As the royal party travels back to the <entity class="NE" id=3189>Red Keep</entity> through the crowded streets , the starving refugees and commoners of <entity class="NE" id=3190>King</entity> 's Landing plead for bread and hurl insults at <entity class="NE" id=3191>King Joffrey</entity> , and ultimately , someone throws cow excrement into <entity class="NE" id=3192>Joffrey</entity> 's face . Despite being accompanied by only a few dozen guards facing hundreds of peasants , <entity class="NE" id=3193>Joffrey</entity> impetuously orders his soldiers to kill the entire crowd . <entity class="NE" id=3194>Sansa</entity> is almost raped . A riot subsequently erupts and spreads throughout the city . The royal party 's guards are soon overwhelmed , and <entity class="NE" id=3195>Joffrey</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3196>Cersei</entity> and <entity class="NE" id=3197>Tyrion</entity> barely make it back to the castle unscathed . The <entity class="NE" id=3198>High Septon</entity> is literally torn apart by the mob . <entity class="NE" id=3199>Tyrion</entity> is enraged by <entity class="NE" id=3200>Joffrey</entity> 's shocking stupidity , for massively overreacting to having cow dung thrown at him , and for not realizing that his orders would cause a riot among the starving peasants and endanger the entire royal party . <entity class="NE" id=3201>Joffrey</entity> , still manically cursing the mob and demanding they all be killed , shrieks that <entity class="NE" id=3202>Tyrion</entity> can not speak to him in that way and petulantly reminds his uncle that he is talking to a king . <entity class="NE" id=3203>Tyrion</entity> then contemptuously slaps his nephew across the face but <entity class="NE" id=3204>Joffrey</entity> does not retaliate . The scant two thousand <entity class="NE" id=3205>City Watch</entity> guards have difficulty containing the riot , and chaos reigns throughout the city . <entity class="NE" id=3206>Tyrion</entity> realizes to his horror that <entity class="NE" id=3207>Sansa Stark</entity> was lost in the crowd . <entity class="NE" id=3208>Joffrey</entity> petulantly refuses to send his men after her , oblivious to her importance as a hostage or the fact that if any harm comes to her , the <entity class="NE" id=3209>Starks</entity> may retaliate by executing his uncle Jaime . <entity class="NE" id=3210>Outside</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3211>Sansa</entity> is dragged away by a mob of angry men and is about to be raped , when <entity class="NE" id=3212>Sandor</entity> `` The <entity class="NE" id=3213>Hound</entity> '' Clegane arrives and slays her assailants . He carries <entity class="NE" id=3214>Sansa</entity> to the castle and orders handmaids to take care of her . <entity class="NE" id=3215>Tyrion</entity> thanks him for saving <entity class="NE" id=3216>Sansa</entity> 's life , but <entity class="NE" id=3217>Sandor</entity> bluntly responds that he did n't do it for him . Beyond the <entity class="NE" id=3218>Wall</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3219>Jon</entity> first lays eyes on <entity class="NE" id=3220>Ygritte</entity> . The scouting party of the <entity class="NE" id=3221>Night's Watch</entity> led by <entity class="NE" id=3222>Qhorin Halfhand</entity> has left the expeditionary base their main force set up at the <entity class="NE" id=3223>Fist</entity> of the <entity class="NE" id=3224>First Men</entity> , and continues searching for the wildlings in the <entity class="NE" id=3225>Frostfangs</entity> mountain range . They encounter a small group of wildling scouts and engage them in combat , killing all except one : a red-haired young woman named <entity class="NE" id=3226>Ygritte</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3227>Qhorin</entity> orders <entity class="NE" id=3228>Jon Snow</entity> to execute her while the rest of them continue on up the mountain . <entity class="NE" id=3229>Jon</entity> hesitates , giving <entity class="NE" id=3230>Ygritte</entity> enough time to make a run for it . <entity class="NE" id=3231>Jon</entity> pursues and captures <entity class="NE" id=3232>Ygritte</entity> , but they have become separated from <entity class="NE" id=3233>Qhorin</entity> 's scouting party . With darkness falling , <entity class="NE" id=3234>Jon</entity> and his prisoner have to settle in for the night , hoping to link back up with <entity class="NE" id=3235>Qhorin</entity> when daylight returns . Across the <entity class="NE" id=3236>Narrow Sea</entity> . <entity class="NE" id=3237>Daenerys</entity> discovers that her guards have been slain and her dragons are missing . In <entity class="NE" id=3238>Qarth</entity> , <entity class="NE" id=3239>Daenerys Targaryen</entity> tries to negotiate with the <entity class="NE" id=3240>Spice King</entity> for ships to return to <entity class="NE" id=3241>Westeros</entity> . However , he considers it to be too risky an investment – considering that she has no army and has no open supporters in <entity class="NE" id=3242>Westeros</entity> – and she receives nothing . Returning with <entity class="NE" id=3243>Xaro Xhoan Daxos</entity> to his mansion , <entity class="NE" id=3244>Daenerys</entity> finds her guards dead , <entity class="NE" id=3245>Irri</entity> strangled to death , and her dragons missing . A hooded figure carries the dragons in a covered box up steps towards a tower .
